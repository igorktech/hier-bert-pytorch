So, let's take a look at what's going on around the country. [SEP] [CLS] You know what? Just bear with me while I take off these annoying pants. Looks like Scotch Wilkinson had a liquid lunch again. [SEP] [CLS] Another hurricane is headed for the tropics. Maybe they'll name this one after my ex-wife. Call it Hurricane Bi... If you're gonna spend two months' salary on a ring, you want to blow your girl's mind. You know what really makes my head explode? The way society has conditioned women to base their self-worth on their engagement ring. I mean, I'm a free-thinking woman. I'm not one of Pavlov's dogs. [SEP] [CLS] Ooh, cookies are ready. [SEP] [CLS] You're not buying any of that I don't want a ring " stuff, are you?
No, I think that's really how she feels. I know I haven't given you a lot of fatherly advice, but I can't let you make this mistake. You got to buy Sabrina an engagement ring. [SEP] [CLS] Whoa, but they are so expensive. You have to do whatever it takes. [SEP] [CLS] I busted my butt doing extra work for your mother's ring. [SEP] [CLS] What kind of work? [SEP] [CLS] Extra work. T.J. Hooker was filming in town. They paid me 50 bucks a day to lay in a creek full of small but very angry turtles. It was awful. Two things I learned: Captain Kirk cannot remember his lines and he is not a hugger. But it doesn't matter. It was worth it.
Your mother loves that ring.
That never gets old. I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your... [SEP] [CLS] Hey, where's your engagement ring? [SEP] [CLS] Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes. It's probably by the sink. [SEP] [CLS] You're gonna go get it, right?
Hey. Is your mom home? [SEP] [CLS] I'm dying to know if she found her ring. I haven't seen her. [SEP] [CLS] Well, I guess I'll work out. Get rid of some of this nervous energy.
Works fast. [SEP] [CLS] Tastes minty. Come on, those candlesticks got to be enough. [SEP] [CLS] Not quite. That is a rare director's cut edition of Cujo on VHS. It's only 20 minutes long. I guess he didn't think much of the dog's performance. Someone definitely is gonna want to buy 20 minutes of Cujo. [SEP] [CLS] What else you got? [SEP] [CLS] That thing work?
It gets hot. [SEP] [CLS] Hot is good. You got a deal.
Burt, what happened? [SEP] [CLS] We got robbed, Virginia. Somebody came into this house. Took several odds and ends. Bastards even got some knickknacks.
How are you gonna give it to her? [SEP] [CLS] Well, I was thinking about getting down on one knee and then slowly opening the box. Dude, that is the missionary position of proposals. [SEP] [CLS] You gotta do better than that. [SEP] [CLS] You're right. I can't just hand it to her. That's lame. [SEP] [CLS] Well, luckily for you, I've spent a lot of time thinking of cool ways to propose to Sabrina. Three of them can be done in this store.
Do you know any members of the band " The Knack "? And would Sabrina be willing to change her name to " Sharona "? No. All right, two of them can be done in this store. [SEP] [CLS] Okay. One more glass of wine and then I'll have the courage to tell Burt I lost my engagement ring. First of all, that's tequila. Here's an idea. [SEP] [CLS] You think Burt would notice if we got a ring that kind of looked like yours? [SEP] [CLS] Of course not, he's a guy. They can identify our nipples from 40 feet away through a wool sweater, but they have no idea what our rings look like. [SEP] [CLS] So why not try this?
Because I'll know. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, I love that ring. [SEP] [CLS] Burt worked so hard to get it. And it's always been there for me, whether I needed to look at it to remind myself how much he loved me or pawn it to pay for groceries. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, I can't believe it's gone. [SEP] [CLS] Oh. I was sure it was safe to pawn because it's so cheap and dinged up, I... and I knew no one else would ever want it.
That's sweet. I mean, it's not just a ring; it... kind of represents your marriage. [SEP] [CLS] Why? Because no one would ever want it? [SEP] [CLS] No, no, just the opposite. All I want is a marriage like yours. One of the reasons I fell in love with Jimmy is the possibility of getting that. [SEP] [CLS] That's why you fell in love with him? Because Burt and I have never been able to figure that one out. [SEP] [CLS] Hey! There you are. Uh, Sabrina, would you do me the honor of reaching your hand into this barrel and grasping a pickle?
No, old people are always sticking their wrinkly hands in there. It's gross. [SEP] [CLS] Listen. I was just with your mother and I realized that an engagement ring is more than just metal and a stone. I know what I said before, but if you got me one, I wouldn't complain.
Usually, when you get advice from a lot of different people, they can't all be right. [SEP] [CLS] Oh... But this time they were. Dad was right that Sabrina really wanted an engagement ring. Burt was right that how you present the ring is as important as the ring itself.
And Mom was right about how much Sabrina would like getting her ring. And it turns out those guys at the medical lab were right about those side effects. [SEP] [CLS] How far up do you think they went?
The light down here is really awful. Maybe you need reading glasses, or you could learn to hold a book with your feet. [SEP] [CLS] That I can do. The hard part's licking my toes to turn the pages. Besides I told you my eyes are fine. [SEP] [CLS] Well, at least turn the book right-side up.
Well, it certainly explains your mom's resentment towards you, but why's she always giving me the stink eye? [SEP] [CLS] Well, some of that's the toilet seat thing. And after two years, I can't say that I blame her. [SEP] [CLS] Well, at least I flush now. [SEP] [CLS] I don't get any points for that? [SEP] [CLS] No, you're not gonna get points for just... not living like an ape.
When did this become about me? [SEP] [CLS] I just don't want to resent our kids because I didn't do all of the things that I wanted to do. [SEP] [CLS] Well, you can't draw. The bells you drew for our wedding invitation looked like two hams taking a walk. [SEP] [CLS] That was a rough sketch with a Magic Marker. [SEP] [CLS] Besides I'm not talking about drawing.
Good,' cause you can't draw. [SEP] [CLS] My point is... I just... there's still things that I want to do before we start a family. [SEP] [CLS] Is this about shooting my gun again? [SEP] [CLS]'Cause going to the range is one thing, going to the dump and picking off rats is another. [SEP] [CLS] I was half-drunk and... mostly kidding. You tried to take it out of my holster.
I was being flirty. Learn to pick up on a signal, buddy.
Yeah, maybe we are in kind of a rut. [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, I feel like I live a pretty full life. I mean, I'm certainly no risk taker. Mm. [SEP] [CLS] What about that time you sat on the Styrofoam cooler at the police picnic? [SEP] [CLS] That was daredevil behavior. I rolled the dice and I lost. [SEP] [CLS] No, everybody lost. And spent the whole day drinking warm beer and eating flat hot dogs. The cooler looked like an airplane crash sight.
Well... I didn't hear anybody complaining about my weight when I anchored the tug-of-war. [SEP] [CLS] Aw, nah. You certainly walked away a hero that day. Even with the deviled eggs stuck to your butt. You know, maybe I should try mixing it up a little bit. Mm. Hey, I still have my trombone from high school and I always wanted to form my own Dixieland band. [SEP] [CLS] Well, to that idea, may I just say, " No, Susanna. Scoff if you want, but Dixieland is an underappreciated American art form. It used to be, but now it's just bad jazz for white folks. Look, you never see Miles Davis walking around in a straw hat wearing garters on his sleeves. That's true... it's a hard look to pull off unless you're scooping ice cream or picking up garbage at Disneyland. [SEP] [CLS] There you are, gentlemen. A walk on the wild side. [SEP] [CLS] Do you have any...? Ketchup.
How about any...? Hot sauce. [SEP] [CLS] Thanks. I'll be back in 12 minutes with your sticky bun and your seltzer water and toothpick. Or maybe just a meat cleaver and a Hefty bag.
Hey, sweetie, you're home early. [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, somebody pulled the fire alarm during last period. Boy, those brats will do anything to get out of class. [SEP] [CLS] Ah, brats, teachers, when you're getting out early, you don't ask a lot of questions.
Major Tires Destroy Superman. Mayor Fires District Supervisor. See, now that makes a lot more sense. Joyce won't even talk to me now. And when we were having sex, she didn't look me in the eye. Probably makes it harder for her to pretend you're someone else. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, yeah, kick me while I'm down, you half-blind bastard. When are you gonna learn, Moranto? [SEP] [CLS] You can't forbid a woman to do something. They live to defy us. You know what those college campuses are like. Reefer-filled coffeehouses, beatniks and free love. [SEP] [CLS] Well, I'm hoping President Eisenhower cleans up the whole mess. [SEP] [CLS] And college professors are the worst! They'll bang anything with a backpack!
What are you getting so worked up for? [SEP] [CLS] Joyce loves you.
So you're gonna tell me you didn't enjoy getting out of school early? [SEP] [CLS] No, I'm telling you, that when you pull the fire alarm, you can't brag to the other kids about it.
Next time we go skating, we need to come up with some sort of signal so when I fall you can get to me a little sooner. [SEP] [CLS] I think you screaming, " For the love of God, help me! [SEP] [CLS] was a pretty clear signal.
Egypt- - one of the great civilizations of antiquity. It was here that one of the world's first writing systems was developed and where vast monuments in stone were built. Then 1,000 years after the Pyramids, another technological revolution took place: a revolution in warfare. The chariot arrived. Over the next few hundred years, the pharaohs of ancient Egypt pushed back their borders and built a mighty empire. Egypt's New Kingdom Empire was the greatest empire that the world had seen. It really was on a massive scale. [SEP] [CLS] Was the chariot the Egyptians' secret weapon, giving them a crucial lead in the arms race? [SEP] [CLS] Were there innovations built into the Egyptian chariot that gave them an edge?
In the years that followed, chariots appear everywhere on tomb and temple walls. And inscriptions alongside the chariots relate how Ahmose and other New Kingdom pharaohs went on to build the most powerful empire the world had ever seen. As they overcame Kushites, Nubians, Canaanites and others, their empire stretched from Sudan up into what is now Turkey. [SEP] [CLS] So was the chariot the key to the Egyptians' military success?
Although work is well underway, Kathy and Robert still have much to learn about the design of these ancient chariots. The Valley of the Kings is behind the ridge. They travel down to Luxor, Egypt's capital city on the Nile 3,000 years ago, to see what secrets they can glean. On a hilly ridge on the west bank of the river are the tombs of ancient nobles and officials. Each tomb is richly decorated with scenes of life from thousands of years ago. [SEP] [CLS] Robert, look! [SEP] [CLS] I think this thing's amazing. [SEP] [CLS] That's a beautifully drawn chariot. Look, you can see your thong through your lynch pin. The little details. They're going to be so helpful to us. [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, yeah. For Robert and Kathy, the paintings and reliefs are like blueprints. They provide a wealth of detail which gives them a real insight into the chariot's construction. It's clear to them both they have a challenge ahead if they're to bring the chariot back to life.
how stable is it as a platform for archers? [SEP] [CLS] Mike wants to find out how difficult it is to hit a target from a moving chariot. He approaches a simulated line of infantry.
The demonstration is convincing. The speed and agility of the chariot allow it to perform the tight turns that would have given the Egyptians a crucial military advantage. You've got a grin from ear to ear. [SEP] [CLS] Well, that was super fun. It's working as it should. [SEP] [CLS] We're making thundering charges, bearing down on the enemy. Tight turns and away.
Good for you! That's a big piece. [SEP] [CLS] Is it yummy?
Don't worry! I'll get out soon. Stay there and keep your mouth shut. [SEP] [CLS] Somebody help Mama! She's going to die in the river! [SEP] [CLS] Fuji? What are you doing? [SEP] [CLS] What's going on?
Is this rice? [SEP] [CLS] It's your pay for a year. You're paid in advance so you better work hard. Mr. Nakagawa sent me for the babysitter.
Granny. [SEP] [CLS] Don't tell anyone. Keep it. That's all I can do for you. I'm sorry, Dear. [SEP] [CLS] Granny, thank you so much. [SEP] [CLS] Hey! She's ready.
It's breakfast time! [SEP] [CLS] You must be hungry.
We'll go into the hills after we eat. [SEP] [CLS] Yes, Boss! It looks delicious! Eat up, fellas! [SEP] [CLS] Some more? [SEP] [CLS] I'm so hungry! [SEP] [CLS] Isn't this radish gruel?
Hands off! [SEP] [CLS] You're cleaning with me. Come on. [SEP] [CLS] She thought she'd eat with us! [SEP] [CLS] Sweep the floor. [SEP] [CLS] Who wants more?
Peasant Haven't you seen a tatami mat before? [SEP] [CLS] Sweep with the direction of the weave, you useless fool! Now sweep!
There's no rice! [SEP] [CLS] Don't be ridiculous. [SEP] [CLS] There is some!
Stop fussing! [SEP] [CLS] Eat fast, shit fast. That's the servant's credo.
Where do you live, little girl? [SEP] [CLS] What were you doing out there? [SEP] [CLS] He found you in the snow and piggybacked you here. You were frozen like ice. [SEP] [CLS] I didn't think you'd make it. But he took care of you. He stayed up all night, keeping you warm like this.
The snow's stopped. We'll take you down the mountain. [SEP] [CLS] Can you find your home once we're in town?
Was the work hard? [SEP] [CLS] So tough you had to run? [SEP] [CLS] I didn't run because it was tough. I didn't steal! But they said that I was a wicked thief. I see. [SEP] [CLS] Do you believe me?
Oshin. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. Nice name.
Did you shoot it? [SEP] [CLS] You're a good shot! [SEP] [CLS] That's amazing!
Shunsaku. [SEP] [CLS] Shunsaku? [SEP] [CLS] Poor boy, he's all sweaty! How he suffers! He still has a bullet lodged in his body so he gets sick when he pushes himself. [SEP] [CLS] A bullet! Why? [SEP] [CLS] He fought in the war. Thousands of people died. It left him traumatized.
Shunsaku!
Shunsaku! [SEP] [CLS] Hey, there. You're going to make it. Oshin has been up all night keeping you cool. [SEP] [CLS] You're okay!
What are you sewing? [SEP] [CLS] You're wasting your time again! For all we know Oshin could be dead.
O my young brother For thee I weep O Brother... you must... [SEP] [CLS] not... die Maybe you're too young to understand that.
Married Less than ten months Have you considered your young wife? Who have you left behind For her to rely on? [SEP] [CLS] O Brother, you must not die
Dad! I saw Oshin's ghost! [SEP] [CLS] Oshin? [SEP] [CLS] Mama! Oshin! You're really Oshin!
Don't worry, Oshin. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, I'm so glad you came back.
I have to go. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin, you're so good with your sister.
Oshin cooked rice by herself? [SEP] [CLS] Yes. That itsy bitsy thing will outdo me! [SEP] [CLS] She's something. I'll go and do the laundry. [SEP] [CLS] Way to go! [SEP] [CLS] Ume will do that.
Should I clean up? [SEP] [CLS] Not until Madam Kuni and Master Seitaro have left. [SEP] [CLS] Isn't there anything to do before I babysit?
Oshin, come here. [SEP] [CLS] Yes. Serve your own rice and soup. [SEP] [CLS] Yes! There's so much left! [SEP] [CLS] Try and eat quickly.
I didn't know rice with wheat was so good! [SEP] [CLS] All we eat at home is radish gruel. [SEP] [CLS] Yummy?
Oshin? [SEP] [CLS] Coming!
My book is missing. It was here this morning. [SEP] [CLS] That's odd. Maybe you misplaced it?
Kayo? [SEP] [CLS] Forgive me. I didn't mean to take it.
What do you expect of a peasant? [SEP] [CLS] She craves what she doesn't have. [SEP] [CLS] Mother, we can't have a thief in the house. It's me, Oshin. Come in.
Oshin, you stole Kayo's book. But you took it without asking. [SEP] [CLS] Answer me! You took it!
As the dusk tide rolls in a plover squawks Though I'm not a plover I'd flap the wings of my heart And fly To a place that's cold and miserable A young heart ls like a straight arrow I weep For there's no consolation [SEP] [CLS] That's enough. You're telling us the truth. [SEP] [CLS] But Grandma! If you can read that well you'd want to pick up a book and read a little. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. People view servants with prejudice. You'd better be more careful.
It sounds nice. [SEP] [CLS] Doesn't it? [SEP] [CLS] Did you buy it? [SEP] [CLS] It was given to me. [SEP] [CLS] By Whom?
Let me have it. Mother will pay you for it. [SEP] [CLS] That harmonica is everything to me! Give it back. [SEP] [CLS] I'll pay you for it! [SEP] [CLS] No! Not for all the money in the world! [SEP] [CLS] Well then!
What have you done!
You wicked child! [SEP] [CLS] Seitaro, don't! [SEP] [CLS] She's just a kid. You can hit me all you want. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. Did you push Kayo? [SEP] [CLS] What made you do that?
It was my fault. I'm asking you why. [SEP] [CLS] You wouldn't do it for no reason.
Did you hurt your hand? [SEP] [CLS] My suspicions weren't unfounded. There's a rumor that she was in hiding with a deserter. She's not innocent.
Now I know that the rumor is true. You kept it secret so you could keep this job. [SEP] [CLS] I'm sorry that I hurt Miss Kayo. But don't put down Shunsaku. He was a kind, gentle man. He taught me to read and write. He wasn't a coward or a traitor. In war, friends and foes are killed. That's why he quit.
Is Miss Kayo OK? [SEP] [CLS] Don't worry. She'll be fine. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. I really wish you could stay but... I can't undermine my son and his wife's decision. [SEP] [CLS] Kayo is a stubborn girl. You two don't get along. It won't go well for you.
I've brought you some gruel. [SEP] [CLS] Miss Kayo, how do you feel?
Welcome back, Madam. We started eating. [SEP] [CLS] Seitaro. [SEP] [CLS] It's decided. The owner of the courier boat company will take Oshin. The rumors don't bother him. Some people can judge for themselves. [SEP] [CLS] Kayo! [SEP] [CLS] Grandma, where are you sending Oshin?
She's going to work for someone else. She can't! You can't kick her out! [SEP] [CLS] Kayo? [SEP] [CLS] She's done nothing bad. I tried to force her to sell me her harmonica. [SEP] [CLS] Kayo. It was my fault. Nobody has ever stood up to me! [SEP] [CLS] Oshin wasn't afraid of me.
I fought back! It was more like play fighting, so please! [SEP] [CLS] Don't kick her out. [SEP] [CLS] Father, Mother, please! [SEP] [CLS] Grandma, don't make Oshin go away! [SEP] [CLS] Kayo.
How about Oshin? [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. [SEP] [CLS] Thank you, ma'am!
Oh, there you are! Happy new year! [SEP] [CLS] Kayo! How you've grown! [SEP] [CLS] She's still a kid inside.
Now we'll be lucky! [SEP] [CLS] Oh, you're so drunk!
You're cheeky! The things you say, girl. [SEP] [CLS] What are those women?
Fuji, make me feel better. [SEP] [CLS] Hands off! [SEP] [CLS] Hey, how about me?
Do you know that woman? [SEP] [CLS] Oshin? The love I feel for you makes me realize I've never loved before... I got n! [SEP] [CLS] You got it again, Miss Kayo. You're so quick.
Were you with the Kagaya's daughter? [SEP] [CLS] They must be taking care of you. [SEP] [CLS] I have nothing to worry about.
Oshin. That's the thing about women. None of us work for our own benefit. They work for their parents, husbands and children. They can't think of themselves. [SEP] [CLS] That's women for you. It's the same with your Mama. She might have to do things for her family that you can't blame her for. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin. Love her with all your heart. She must have had it tough...
Leave this to us and go. [SEP] [CLS] You don't want your granny to die before you get there! [SEP] [CLS] Where is the rice? [SEP] [CLS] Coming!
Here's my kimono. Wear this and go home. [SEP] [CLS] Oshin, your grandmother is waiting for you.
Granny, I'll get you some gruel. [SEP] [CLS] Leave her alone. It will do no good. [SEP] [CLS] Don't be foolish!
Are you awake? You slept well. Your dad and the boys are making charcoal. [SEP] [CLS] I'll get your breakfast.
Alright, I'm going to spray some rosewater. [SEP] [CLS] Okay, take a deep breath.
It was making a running sound like even, even when it wasn't, just when it was not in use. And then it would stop. [SEP] [CLS] Okay, well did you look in the back. Like did you look in the tank of the toilet? [SEP] [CLS] Mm-mm. Sometimes the chain just falls off. And you just reattach it. Is there, is there anything that I, I can... [SEP] [CLS] No, everything is everything's under to control.
Well, I mean you're at my house every night. [SEP] [CLS] Well, it's not every night. I mean, rents really high right now, you know. I mean, it just makes sense. [SEP] [CLS] Or, you could move in here until you find a place that's suitable. There's plenty of room, the door's always open to you. [SEP] [CLS] Thank you brother. That is a very generous offer Paul um... [SEP] [CLS] Thank you. I mean it makes sense right?
That's what I'm saying. Right? [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, I mean, you're going to regret it though, because I'm a complete and utter slob. Like I already don't know that. I know but once all my stuff is there. Alright. [SEP] [CLS] So you'll move in. [SEP] [CLS] Yeah. That's great. [SEP] [CLS] Why not. And you guys can have dinner at our house.
Dad? [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, I was thinking, um. I think we need some new blood. [SEP] [CLS] We could, could advertise. [SEP] [CLS] That's not, that's too expensive. We have to, we have to spend money to make money right?
So, when was the last time you saw a Dentist? [SEP] [CLS] About five years ago.
Okay, let's open up and take a look. [SEP] [CLS] Alright, what have we got going on here?
Is it warm enough in here? [SEP] [CLS] It feels nice.
E3. Dad, he's like totally freaking out. [SEP] [CLS] Mirror. He loves you. He says you cured him. [SEP] [CLS] Cured him of what? [SEP] [CLS] Well, he had this horrible pain. It was in his jaw. [SEP] [CLS] TMJ? Yeah. Temporomandibular Joint disorder.
Right, right. It was so bad that he had to stop singing. Since he's left office and he's had no pain. My grand-daughter has TMJ. Maybe you could cure her. [SEP] [CLS] Well, that's doubtful Mrs Olsen. But if she comes in, I'd be happy to take a look. Let's open please. Alright.
Oh... I hate to disappoint you, but if you came here hoping that I could somehow magically take away your pain, I can't do that. [SEP] [CLS] Okay. I understand. [SEP] [CLS] Do you? Yes. Just do whatever you did for the last guy. The guy you cured.
And Abby came running in here, Grandpa Douglas had just mixed a batch of this... and everywhere it was all over his face. I was sitting right where you are and giggling and I mean... Oh my gosh, Look what else came. Look what you are doing for people. [SEP] [CLS] I dont', I don't understand it. It's not like I'm doing anything differently. Henry's singing again. [SEP] [CLS] Well, that that's great, but I'm not responsible for that. He thinks you are.
Oh, hey Henry. Hey Jenny. [SEP] [CLS] Did you come back to see my dad again? [SEP] [CLS] Um, well, both of you actually. I um, wanted to give you tickets to my show. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, oh wow, thank you. Um, it wouldn't be happening if it weren't for your dad. [SEP] [CLS] That's incredible. Thanks.
No, it's just a little invite only thing. It's no big deal. [SEP] [CLS] No, that's cool. We'll definitely, definitely come. Cool um, I ah, I made this for you. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, is this your music? [SEP] [CLS] No, it's just some songs that I thought you'd like.
And um, how long have you had this pain? [SEP] [CLS] Oh, for like, ever. That's what if feels like at least. [SEP] [CLS] Well it started in a kind of on and off way. Um, I was still working on the boat, so it was before 1998. [SEP] [CLS] Right, right. And um, then it started to get real bad. And it's right um, right in here? [SEP] [CLS] It's both sides. Both sides.
Both sides hurts. So that was before 1998 when it started and then ah...
What are these? [SEP] [CLS] Ecstasy. [SEP] [CLS] What? Are you taking that?
That tofu was so, I don't usually like tofu and I just... [SEP] [CLS] Oh thanks. I cooked it in like really special olive oil. So.
Welcome. Thank you. [SEP] [CLS] So did you have a particular goal in mind for today?
Are you're eyes closed? [SEP] [CLS] Yep.
Pop your legs up on the couch. Just cross them over. Can you get that up there? [SEP] [CLS] Stay still, stay still. Just don't let go. Don't let go. Just relax down a little bit.
So what we're gonna do Dillon, in the first step is we're just going to put some articulate... Are you ready? [SEP] [CLS] Alright. One, two, three... How's that feel? [SEP] [CLS] Can you... Better? [SEP] [CLS] I think it is.
Thank you so much. You're welcome. [SEP] [CLS] Thank you Oh you're welcome.
See how that is. [SEP] [CLS] Good. Looks good.
Hey in here? Scaller? Hello can you hear? I want my money back please. [SEP] [CLS] This guy is a God-damn fraud. Fucking TMJ's back. Hello are you here? [SEP] [CLS] Be right back. I'll be right back. [SEP] [CLS] Hello? Yeah, hey buddy. Go ahead and do that there. Ah, he's he's Doctor He's in the middle of a procedure. This guy's a god-damn fraud. [SEP] [CLS] Hello! Doctor. Oh there you are. You did not cure my TMJ.
Abby? [SEP] [CLS] Hey. It's Adrian. [SEP] [CLS] Wow. Thought that was you. [SEP] [CLS] Can I sit down?
Did it hurt? [SEP] [CLS] I don't know. That part I don't remember.
What, what is that? [SEP] [CLS] Go on in. Check it out. You might like it.
How long were you a messenger for? [SEP] [CLS] Like five or six years. [SEP] [CLS] Is that when you first got into like, like all the biking? [SEP] [CLS] Yeah. It was just so much different then, just a different vibe. It was more my anarchist stage. [SEP] [CLS] Anarchist cycling?
Yeah. I was just one angry dude. [SEP] [CLS] That's hard to imagine.
I'm on my way asswipe! [SEP] [CLS] How did you get out of there? [SEP] [CLS] Where are you? Forget it. If you tell me where the key is I can just hide it for you. [SEP] [CLS] I have the key, how many times must I tell you?! [SEP] [CLS] When are they arriving?
The rat squad'll be here within the hour. [SEP] [CLS] Fine, get off my ass. I'll be there soon, don't touch my stuff. [SEP] [CLS] So get here ASAP. [SEP] [CLS] Got another call. [SEP] [CLS] When will you be back?
The elders are upset that head of the family is gone. [SEP] [CLS] I wouldn't have left the funeral if it wasn't serious.
Hey mister. [SEP] [CLS] Mister.
Goddammit! EMERGENCY CALL SISTER [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, what? [SEP] [CLS] Daddy! Whatcha doing?
Evening. DUI checkpoint, sir. [SEP] [CLS] DUI check. Evening, officer. [SEP] [CLS] I... I'm Western District Homicide Det. Ko Gun-su... Northern District officer Lee Dong-yun. [SEP] [CLS] I see, thanks for your work. Keep at it, thanks bud. [SEP] [CLS] Could you blow into this?
Evening, officer! [SEP] [CLS] I'm Western District Homicide Det. Ko. I had a sip at my mother's funeral... Couldn't I get a pass? [SEP] [CLS] No ID, and he was acting suspicious. [SEP] [CLS] Officer Lee, come on, man. What's your ID number? [SEP] [CLS] Come on, we're all cops here.
So what's your ID number?
How can you do this to fellow cops, goddammit! [SEP] [CLS] Open this drawer. [SEP] [CLS] Why so many locks on this? [SEP] [CLS] Is Det. Ko here? [SEP] [CLS] He's mourning at the moment.
Hammer. [SEP] [CLS] What's inside? [SEP] [CLS] He said to leave it.
You're all fucked. [SEP] [CLS] What the hell happened here?!
What brings you here past midnight? [SEP] [CLS] You're accusing a mourner over some money without context? [SEP] [CLS] IAD isn't run by humans? [SEP] [CLS] We're only following our orders. [SEP] [CLS] Ship out. Come back after the funeral.
Don't just stand there, pack up! This here is a list, of those who took bribes from local businesses. [SEP] [CLS] I said pack up!
Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you sleeping? [SEP] [CLS] I already did. Where's the cake?
Make room in the grave for us too. [SEP] [CLS] I'm sorry sir. [SEP] [CLS] Chief... I'm sorry, but could we do this later?
Wait... You want me to... take the heat for you all? While grieving? [SEP] [CLS] What a fucking timing! [SEP] [CLS] I'm sorry, we really are. But we all can't go down. This should end with you. [SEP] [CLS] I'll take care of you, so don't worry. [SEP] [CLS] Take care of me?! Cover your own ass! You're not getting out of this! Even your brothel trips are on record!
'Ms. Autumn' is your regular, right? Motherfucker, are you nuts?! [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, fuckhead! I wish I was mental! [SEP] [CLS] Fuck you man! Come at me!
My condolences. [SEP] [CLS] Take care, sir.
Where are you going?! [SEP] [CLS] Gun-su!
Sir, I'd like some private moment with my mother one last time. [SEP] [CLS] But... that's rather unusual. [SEP] [CLS] Okay. Until midnight. Thank you.
By the way, what's that for? [SEP] [CLS] These are for my daughter.
Please, not yet! [SEP] [CLS] I'm begging you! [SEP] [CLS] Hang up! Please! I'm so close! [SEP] [CLS] Mom, mom, please, do something!
Why is this so heavy? [SEP] [CLS] Careful, go slowly. Mother...
It's pretty fast. [SEP] [CLS] Mina, that's enough, I'm gonna get mad. IAD backed off quite easily. They confiscated the money and called it quits. We all went to great lengths to save your ass. [SEP] [CLS] We're the best, aren't we? [SEP] [CLS] Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow. [SEP] [CLS] Okay, I understand.
Mister, get out. [SEP] [CLS] Are you drunk? [SEP] [CLS] Good afternoon. Western District Det. Ko. [SEP] [CLS] Why did you park on a right-turn lane? [SEP] [CLS] You know better. This is a recently confiscated homemade C4, the explosive yield is tremendous, and can be remotely detonated. So desperate to make an impression on the new commissioner. Not too many reporters. It detonates 2 minutes after pushing this button. We'll start the demonstration.
DEMONSTRATION OF I.E.D. We'll also blow 4 societal evils as part of our campaign with the bomb. [SEP] [CLS] Armed.
Fucking dog... Chief, maybe it was a prank call. [SEP] [CLS] No, I can feel it. [SEP] [CLS] Sir, I don't think he's here either. [SEP] [CLS] Where is he then?
What the hell? No one's here. [SEP] [CLS] Dammit! Chief, take a look! [SEP] [CLS] So he did live here. Maybe he got tipped off. Let's look around for any evidence.
How's the hit-and-run case? [SEP] [CLS] The video quality is bad, and this must be the spot, but nothing yet. [SEP] [CLS] Bad quality, huh? [SEP] [CLS] Officer Lee. Yes, sir?
Are we still going away for the weekend? [SEP] [CLS] For Mina's birthday. [SEP] [CLS] We are, I told you already. [SEP] [CLS] Gun-su. I wanna talk about something, don't be mad, okay? Can't we kick out our shop tenant and open a toast shop there? [SEP] [CLS] I'm told snack shops do well there! I'll pay the full rent!
We can't kick them out before lease's up. [SEP] [CLS] But you're a cop. [SEP] [CLS] Cops aren't gangsters! [SEP] [CLS] Come on, let me. Please? [SEP] [CLS] We can't live off you forever.
By the way. What now! [SEP] [CLS] Did mom have a man?
What's wrong? Huh? Had a nightmare? [SEP] [CLS] Were you napping? [SEP] [CLS] We've been hiking all day.
How can a cop be so bad at a chase? Did you give it a thought? Can we talk now? [SEP] [CLS] I have a question. Okay. [SEP] [CLS] How did you see me... burying Lee? It was pitch dark. [SEP] [CLS] Dark? Doesn't mean I can't. [SEP] [CLS] Let's not get sidetracked.
You didn't see it yourself. You don't know where Lee is.
Answer the damn phone. [SEP] [CLS] Dinner anyone? Western District... [SEP] [CLS] Sure, I'm friggin' starving. One moment... He wants to report a car accident. [SEP] [CLS] Then transfer to traffic. Hey, hey, hey!
Almost had a heart attack. [SEP] [CLS] That's Lt. Park?
There are 2 types of humans. One who lowers his tail before the alpha. And the one who tries hard after a beat. [SEP] [CLS] Which one are you?
Bullet holes... [SEP] [CLS] He was already dead?
Yo, Gwang-min! Why's it so hard to reach you?! [SEP] [CLS] I thought Lt. Park got to you already.
Asshole, I'm not here for you! Let's just chat! [SEP] [CLS] Stop right there!
How did you end up like this? [SEP] [CLS] Forget it, just drop it. I'll confess back at the station, so let's go. [SEP] [CLS] I'm really tired today. Whatever happens, I just wanna rest. [SEP] [CLS] Rest? [SEP] [CLS] You wanna rest?
Always so nonchalant. Manslaughter and disposal of body will get you near life. [SEP] [CLS] Who cares about you, but your kid? [SEP] [CLS] You drive me insane. [SEP] [CLS] Absolutely insane.
Would I live comfortably with you locked up? [SEP] [CLS] You got an interesting fate. [SEP] [CLS] Your mother's funeral is barely over, and now this? [SEP] [CLS] Sang-ho. [SEP] [CLS] Don't thank me, I don't wanna hear it. Help me. What now?! I'm being blackmailed by a cop.
What's this nonsense? [SEP] [CLS] You know him. Park Chang-min. [SEP] [CLS] I think he killed Lee too. [SEP] [CLS] That corpse up there, that's Lee. [SEP] [CLS] You have to believe everything I tell you, okay? That night... I did hit someone.
How was the aim? The driver's good eh? [SEP] [CLS] Chatting up is all but over. Dig up Lee by 6 a.m.
Welcome home. [SEP] [CLS] Hey. Mina's sleeping.
Slow down now. [SEP] [CLS] That's far enough. Bring the body over.
Hold it, stay put. [SEP] [CLS] Look what we got here? [SEP] [CLS] Hold still asshole! Car key... Got anything else? [SEP] [CLS] Well, look at this.
Still inside. [SEP] [CLS] Those bullet holes, did you shoot him? [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, about that. [SEP] [CLS] Okay, I shot him, then bam! You ran him over. [SEP] [CLS] So who killed him?
Yeah, I'm on my way. What's Mina doing? [SEP] [CLS] Hold on. [SEP] [CLS] Mina, it's daddy. [SEP] [CLS] Sweetie, it's dad. [SEP] [CLS] Did you eat your birthday breakfast?
Yes, I ate so much. While I'm not there, be good to aunt and uncle. [SEP] [CLS] Have all your meals, okay? [SEP] [CLS] Okay. Get here fast, daddy. [SEP] [CLS] Sure, sweetie. [SEP] [CLS] Wait a little longer.
Daddy, bye! [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, bye bye. [SEP] [CLS] I love you, daddy! [SEP] [CLS] When's dad coming? Very soon.
Surprised? [SEP] [CLS] I was too.
I understand how you feel, but life isn't all about that. A year flies by when you're relaxing in the country. Giving your severance to Choi's mother is fine. [SEP] [CLS] But what can you do besides being a cop? [SEP] [CLS] There're over 12,000 jobs in this country. I'll find something. [SEP] [CLS] With you gone, I got nobody! [SEP] [CLS] Gun-su... Remember when you became a cop?
You had 1 adamant goal. [SEP] [CLS] Retirement with full benefits. [SEP] [CLS] Yeah, the ultimate goal of all civil servants. [SEP] [CLS] Let's not lose focus. [SEP] [CLS] I'll delay your resignation, so come back soon.
Sir, make a border of the mound, make it strong. So it can't be dug up. It's not a king's tomb, no one will dig it up. Just make sure it's strong and firm. [SEP] [CLS] Your mother raised her children well. No one tends their parents graves this well nowadays. I've noticed you before. [SEP] [CLS] You're a good son, a very good son. [SEP] [CLS] Feels nice? " Good son. [SEP] [CLS] With you out of work, how will we live now?
What a life... [SEP] [CLS] Young-chul. Yes?
Yes! Trent: Damn it. That was supposed to be a bullet, not a staple. [SEP] [CLS] What the hell?! Come on, guys! How are we gonna throw Frank's birthday party in this mess? [SEP] [CLS] Okay, look, I can explain.
Welcome to Stock Room. May I help you? [SEP] [CLS] Yes. We were wondering if you might be able to tell us who bought this? [SEP] [CLS] It's a ball stretcher. [SEP] [CLS] I'm not very familiar with the inventory at the Stock Room. I only work here part time to raise money for my church to go to Europe and tour famous cathedrals. [SEP] [CLS] You couldn't have just applied for a job at Starbucks?
Oh no. My religion forbids me to be even near caffeine. [SEP] [CLS] But it's okay to work here?
The store must keep sales records. Would you mind if we take a quick peek? [SEP] [CLS] I do not think the owner would approve. We would be happy to contribute to your trip. Wouldn't we guys? [SEP] [CLS] Wood, give her twenty bucks. Me? Why do I have to give her money? We know how much that stupid web cam show of yours makes? [SEP] [CLS] No more free rides. Pay her. Fine. There you go. They keep the book in back. So I will take you there. Only one can come. Other two wait to see if owner come. [SEP] [CLS] I'll go. I'll be back in a minute.
Come on you guys, this isn't funny! [SEP] [CLS] Hey guys? [SEP] [CLS] Hey church girl. Where is everybody?
What the fuck is going on here? [SEP] [CLS] Put this on! I thought I told you to wait outside! Get that shirt off! [SEP] [CLS] Do not disobey Mistress Lena or you will be punished like your friends here. [SEP] [CLS] Mistress Lena? Really? What's with the outfit and the voice? [SEP] [CLS] I can't believe you feel for that meek Asian stereotype.
It proves that you are a racist pig. You've got to be kidding me. Do I look like I'm kidding? [SEP] [CLS] Stop. Stop. Please stop. I will stop when I am ready to stop! Get down! Oh, don't worry Sasquatch. I didn't forget about you. It's kind of like Wheel of Fortune, isn't it? Except there's no fortune and I can zap your nutsuck whenever I feel like it.
Does your church group know that you talk like this? They probably don't like it. [SEP] [CLS] Did I say you could speak? Get down! [SEP] [CLS] This has all been really very entertaining and strangely elaborate. [SEP] [CLS] I didn't know we were in for this. [SEP] [CLS] We're not into the whole BDSM thing, okay? We are just here for some information from your books.
All right. How about this? Two of you can go look at my books if one of you will stay and take this.
And now, the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. The doors have not yet opened for dinner service. [SEP] [CLS] Gina, what's going on? [SEP] [CLS] Um, I can't function. And Gina is already feeling the pressure. I'm sorry that I'm doing this, but...
I just needed a rest. And I'm gonna bounce back really fast. [SEP] [CLS] All right, Jacqueline, so what did I miss? [SEP] [CLS] What'd you miss? You missed everything. [SEP] [CLS] All right, ladies. Let's go.
All of you, taste that. It's too spicy, and it's disgusting. [SEP] [CLS] Trash. And again, scallops cooked beautifully. [SEP] [CLS] What the is going on? [SEP] [CLS] It's like deja vu in this. [SEP] [CLS] How many times have you cooked scallops tonight and not served them?
Twice, chef. Sorry, bro. [SEP] [CLS] Sebastian, get it together!
Seriously, slice the lamb. [SEP] [CLS] How long does it really take? [SEP] [CLS] How much of an amateur are you? [SEP] [CLS] Where's the lamb? [SEP] [CLS] Just cut through it, babe. Cut through it.
I'm trying. [SEP] [CLS] Oh, my God, this bitch is cutting lamb for 6 hours now. Bitch, there's only 24 hours in a day. I want that lamb now.
It's just over an hour into Hell's Kitchen's opening night, and the blue team has failed to deliver a single entree to the dining room. [SEP] [CLS] How much longer could it be? [SEP] [CLS] And the unwelcome return of Sebastian... [SEP] [CLS] Chef, can I please come back, chef? [SEP] [CLS] You. You come here, you.
Has pushed chef Ramsay to the limit. [SEP] [CLS] You, for the last time, take him and him and get out! [SEP] [CLS] And let me tell you something. You come back downstairs again, you'll be leaving through the front door. Now get out! Yes, chef. Three of you.
After a rough dinner service where almost the entire team was kicked out of the kitchen, the men have made a tough decision. We have nominated Jeremy. [SEP] [CLS] But they are not done yet. [SEP] [CLS] Second nominee and why? [SEP] [CLS] Our second nominee is... Sebastian.
Sebastian, seriously? You want to around in the middle of service? Why did you come in here? [SEP] [CLS] I love cooking. This is something I love to do, and I've been... I've put in my time. [SEP] [CLS] Today. I know I dropped the ball. It's just sometimes my personality comes out in the kitchen. [SEP] [CLS] Before I came here, I knew one of my biggest problems, one of my biggest challenges, is my attitude. And it's something I have to correct. [SEP] [CLS] Jeremy. You're one of the youngest in this competition.
