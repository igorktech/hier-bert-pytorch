So, let 's take a look at what 's going on around the country. [SEP] You know what? Just bear with me while I take off these annoying pants. Looks like Scotch Wilkinson had a liquid lunch again. [SEP] Another hurricane is headed for the tropics. Maybe they 'll name this one after my ex-wife. Call it Hurricane Bi... If you 're gonna spend two months ' salary on a ring, you want to blow your girl 's mind. You know what really makes my head explode? The way society has conditioned women to base their self-worth on their engagement ring. I mean, I 'm a free-thinking woman. I 'm not one of Pavlov 's dogs. [SEP] Ooh, cookies are ready. [SEP] You 're not buying any of that I don 't want a ring " stuff, are you?
No, I think that 's really how she feels. I know I haven 't given you a lot of fatherly advice, but I can 't let you make this mistake. You got to buy Sabrina an engagement ring. [SEP] Whoa, but they are so expensive. You have to do whatever it takes. [SEP] I busted my butt doing extra work for your mother 's ring. [SEP] What kind of work? [SEP] Extra work. T.J. Hooker was filming in town. They paid me 50 bucks a day to lay in a creek full of small but very angry turtles. It was awful. Two things I learned: Captain Kirk cannot remember his lines and he is not a hugger. But it doesn 't matter. It was worth it.
Your mother loves that ring.
That never gets old. I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your... [SEP] Hey, where 's your engagement ring? [SEP] Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes. It 's probably by the sink. [SEP] You 're gonna go get it, right?
Hey. Is your mom home? [SEP] I 'm dying to know if she found her ring. I haven 't seen her. [SEP] Well, I guess I 'll work out. Get rid of some of this nervous energy.
Works fast. [SEP] Tastes minty. Come on, those candlesticks got to be enough. [SEP] Not quite. That is a rare director 's cut edition of Cujo on VHS. It 's only 20 minutes long. I guess he didn 't think much of the dog 's performance. Someone definitely is gonna want to buy 20 minutes of Cujo. [SEP] What else you got? [SEP] That thing work?
It gets hot. [SEP] Hot is good. You got a deal.
Burt, what happened? [SEP] We got robbed, Virginia. Somebody came into this house. Took several odds and ends. Bastards even got some knickknacks.
How are you gonna give it to her? [SEP] Well, I was thinking about getting down on one knee and then slowly opening the box. Dude, that is the missionary position of proposals. [SEP] You gotta do better than that. [SEP] You 're right. I can 't just hand it to her. That 's lame. [SEP] Well, luckily for you, I 've spent a lot of time thinking of cool ways to propose to Sabrina. Three of them can be done in this store.
Do you know any members of the band " The Knack "? And would Sabrina be willing to change her name to " Sharona "? No. All right, two of them can be done in this store. [SEP] Okay. One more glass of wine and then I 'll have the courage to tell Burt I lost my engagement ring. First of all, that 's tequila. Here 's an idea. [SEP] You think Burt would notice if we got a ring that kind of looked like yours? [SEP] Of course not, he 's a guy. They can identify our nipples from 40 feet away through a wool sweater, but they have no idea what our rings look like. [SEP] So why not try this?
Because I 'll know. [SEP] Oh, I love that ring. [SEP] Burt worked so hard to get it. And it 's always been there for me, whether I needed to look at it to remind myself how much he loved me or pawn it to pay for groceries. [SEP] Oh, I can 't believe it 's gone. [SEP] Oh. I was sure it was safe to pawn because it 's so cheap and dinged up, I... and I knew no one else would ever want it.
That 's sweet. I mean, it 's not just a ring; it... kind of represents your marriage. [SEP] Why? Because no one would ever want it? [SEP] No, no, just the opposite. All I want is a marriage like yours. One of the reasons I fell in love with Jimmy is the possibility of getting that. [SEP] That 's why you fell in love with him? Because Burt and I have never been able to figure that one out. [SEP] Hey! There you are. Uh, Sabrina, would you do me the honor of reaching your hand into this barrel and grasping a pickle?
No, old people are always sticking their wrinkly hands in there. It 's gross. [SEP] Listen. I was just with your mother and I realized that an engagement ring is more than just metal and a stone. I know what I said before, but if you got me one, I wouldn 't complain.
Usually, when you get advice from a lot of different people, they can 't all be right. [SEP] Oh... But this time they were. Dad was right that Sabrina really wanted an engagement ring. Burt was right that how you present the ring is as important as the ring itself.
And Mom was right about how much Sabrina would like getting her ring. And it turns out those guys at the medical lab were right about those side effects. [SEP] How far up do you think they went?
The light down here is really awful. Maybe you need reading glasses, or you could learn to hold a book with your feet. [SEP] That I can do. The hard part 's licking my toes to turn the pages. Besides I told you my eyes are fine. [SEP] Well, at least turn the book right-side up.
Well, it certainly explains your mom 's resentment towards you, but why 's she always giving me the stink eye? [SEP] Well, some of that 's the toilet seat thing. And after two years, I can 't say that I blame her. [SEP] Well, at least I flush now. [SEP] I don 't get any points for that? [SEP] No, you 're not gonna get points for just... not living like an ape.
When did this become about me? [SEP] I just don 't want to resent our kids because I didn 't do all of the things that I wanted to do. [SEP] Well, you can 't draw. The bells you drew for our wedding invitation looked like two hams taking a walk. [SEP] That was a rough sketch with a Magic Marker. [SEP] Besides I 'm not talking about drawing.
Good, ' cause you can 't draw. [SEP] My point is... I just... there 's still things that I want to do before we start a family. [SEP] Is this about shooting my gun again? [SEP] 'Cause going to the range is one thing, going to the dump and picking off rats is another. [SEP] I was half-drunk and... mostly kidding. You tried to take it out of my holster.
I was being flirty. Learn to pick up on a signal, buddy.
Yeah, maybe we are in kind of a rut. [SEP] Yeah, I feel like I live a pretty full life. I mean, I 'm certainly no risk taker. Mm. [SEP] What about that time you sat on the Styrofoam cooler at the police picnic? [SEP] That was daredevil behavior. I rolled the dice and I lost. [SEP] No, everybody lost. And spent the whole day drinking warm beer and eating flat hot dogs. The cooler looked like an airplane crash sight.
Well... I didn 't hear anybody complaining about my weight when I anchored the tug-of-war. [SEP] Aw, nah. You certainly walked away a hero that day. Even with the deviled eggs stuck to your butt. You know, maybe I should try mixing it up a little bit. Mm. Hey, I still have my trombone from high school and I always wanted to form my own Dixieland band. [SEP] Well, to that idea, may I just say, " No, Susanna. Scoff if you want, but Dixieland is an underappreciated American art form. It used to be, but now it 's just bad jazz for white folks. Look, you never see Miles Davis walking around in a straw hat wearing garters on his sleeves. That 's true... it 's a hard look to pull off unless you 're scooping ice cream or picking up garbage at Disneyland. [SEP] There you are, gentlemen. A walk on the wild side. [SEP] Do you have any...? Ketchup.
How about any...? Hot sauce. [SEP] Thanks. I 'll be back in 12 minutes with your sticky bun and your seltzer water and toothpick. Or maybe just a meat cleaver and a Hefty bag.
Hey, sweetie, you 're home early. [SEP] Yeah, somebody pulled the fire alarm during last period. Boy, those brats will do anything to get out of class. [SEP] Ah, brats, teachers, when you 're getting out early, you don 't ask a lot of questions.
Major Tires Destroy Superman. Mayor Fires District Supervisor. See, now that makes a lot more sense. Joyce won 't even talk to me now. And when we were having sex, she didn 't look me in the eye. Probably makes it harder for her to pretend you 're someone else. [SEP] Oh, yeah, kick me while I 'm down, you half-blind bastard. When are you gonna learn, Moranto? [SEP] You can 't forbid a woman to do something. They live to defy us. You know what those college campuses are like. Reefer-filled coffeehouses, beatniks and free love. [SEP] Well, I 'm hoping President Eisenhower cleans up the whole mess. [SEP] And college professors are the worst! They 'll bang anything with a backpack!
What are you getting so worked up for? [SEP] Joyce loves you.
So you 're gonna tell me you didn 't enjoy getting out of school early? [SEP] No, I 'm telling you, that when you pull the fire alarm, you can 't brag to the other kids about it.
Next time we go skating, we need to come up with some sort of signal so when I fall you can get to me a little sooner. [SEP] I think you screaming, " For the love of God, help me! [SEP] was a pretty clear signal.
Egypt- - one of the great civilizations of antiquity. It was here that one of the world 's first writing systems was developed and where vast monuments in stone were built. Then 1,000 years after the Pyramids, another technological revolution took place: a revolution in warfare. The chariot arrived. Over the next few hundred years, the pharaohs of ancient Egypt pushed back their borders and built a mighty empire. Egypt 's New Kingdom Empire was the greatest empire that the world had seen. It really was on a massive scale. [SEP] Was the chariot the Egyptians' secret weapon, giving them a crucial lead in the arms race? [SEP] Were there innovations built into the Egyptian chariot that gave them an edge?
In the years that followed, chariots appear everywhere on tomb and temple walls. And inscriptions alongside the chariots relate how Ahmose and other New Kingdom pharaohs went on to build the most powerful empire the world had ever seen. As they overcame Kushites, Nubians, Canaanites and others, their empire stretched from Sudan up into what is now Turkey. [SEP] So was the chariot the key to the Egyptians ' military success?
Although work is well underway, Kathy and Robert still have much to learn about the design of these ancient chariots. The Valley of the Kings is behind the ridge. They travel down to Luxor, Egypt 's capital city on the Nile 3,000 years ago, to see what secrets they can glean. On a hilly ridge on the west bank of the river are the tombs of ancient nobles and officials. Each tomb is richly decorated with scenes of life from thousands of years ago. [SEP] Robert, look! [SEP] I think this thing 's amazing. [SEP] That 's a beautifully drawn chariot. Look, you can see your thong through your lynch pin. The little details. They 're going to be so helpful to us. [SEP] Yeah, yeah. For Robert and Kathy, the paintings and reliefs are like blueprints. They provide a wealth of detail which gives them a real insight into the chariot 's construction. It 's clear to them both they have a challenge ahead if they 're to bring the chariot back to life.
how stable is it as a platform for archers? [SEP] Mike wants to find out how difficult it is to hit a target from a moving chariot. He approaches a simulated line of infantry.
The demonstration is convincing. The speed and agility of the chariot allow it to perform the tight turns that would have given the Egyptians a crucial military advantage. You 've got a grin from ear to ear. [SEP] Well, that was super fun. It 's working as it should. [SEP] We 're making thundering charges, bearing down on the enemy. Tight turns and away.
Good for you! That 's a big piece. [SEP] Is it yummy?
Don 't worry! I 'll get out soon. Stay there and keep your mouth shut. [SEP] Somebody help Mama! She 's going to die in the river! [SEP] Fuji? What are you doing? [SEP] What 's going on?
Is this rice? [SEP] It 's your pay for a year. You 're paid in advance so you better work hard. Mr. Nakagawa sent me for the babysitter.
Granny. [SEP] Don 't tell anyone. Keep it. That 's all I can do for you. I 'm sorry, Dear. [SEP] Granny, thank you so much. [SEP] Hey! She 's ready.
It 's breakfast time! [SEP] You must be hungry.
We 'll go into the hills after we eat. [SEP] Yes, Boss! It looks delicious! Eat up, fellas! [SEP] Some more? [SEP] I 'm so hungry! [SEP] Isn 't this radish gruel?
Hands off! [SEP] You 're cleaning with me. Come on. [SEP] She thought she 'd eat with us! [SEP] Sweep the floor. [SEP] Who wants more?
Peasant Haven 't you seen a tatami mat before? [SEP] Sweep with the direction of the weave, you useless fool! Now sweep!
There 's no rice! [SEP] Don 't be ridiculous. [SEP] There is some!
Stop fussing! [SEP] Eat fast, shit fast. That 's the servant 's credo.
Where do you live, little girl? [SEP] What were you doing out there? [SEP] He found you in the snow and piggybacked you here. You were frozen like ice. [SEP] I didn 't think you 'd make it. But he took care of you. He stayed up all night, keeping you warm like this.
The snow 's stopped. We 'll take you down the mountain. [SEP] Can you find your home once we 're in town?
Was the work hard? [SEP] So tough you had to run? [SEP] I didn 't run because it was tough. I didn 't steal! But they said that I was a wicked thief. I see. [SEP] Do you believe me?
Oshin. [SEP] Oshin. Nice name.
Did you shoot it? [SEP] You 're a good shot! [SEP] That 's amazing!
Shunsaku. [SEP] Shunsaku? [SEP] Poor boy, he 's all sweaty! How he suffers! He still has a bullet lodged in his body so he gets sick when he pushes himself. [SEP] A bullet! Why? [SEP] He fought in the war. Thousands of people died. It left him traumatized.
Shunsaku!
Shunsaku! [SEP] Hey, there. You 're going to make it. Oshin has been up all night keeping you cool. [SEP] You 're okay!
What are you sewing? [SEP] You 're wasting your time again! For all we know Oshin could be dead.
O my young brother For thee I weep O Brother... you must... [SEP] not... die Maybe you 're too young to understand that.
Married Less than ten months Have you considered your young wife? Who have you left behind For her to rely on? [SEP] O Brother, you must not die
Dad! I saw Oshin 's ghost! [SEP] Oshin? [SEP] Mama! Oshin! You 're really Oshin!
Don 't worry, Oshin. [SEP] Oh, I 'm so glad you came back.
I have to go. [SEP] Oshin, you 're so good with your sister.
Oshin cooked rice by herself? [SEP] Yes. That itsy bitsy thing will outdo me! [SEP] She 's something. I 'll go and do the laundry. [SEP] Way to go! [SEP] Ume will do that.
Should I clean up? [SEP] Not until Madam Kuni and Master Seitaro have left. [SEP] Isn 't there anything to do before I babysit?
Oshin, come here. [SEP] Yes. Serve your own rice and soup. [SEP] Yes! There 's so much left! [SEP] Try and eat quickly.
I didn 't know rice with wheat was so good! [SEP] All we eat at home is radish gruel. [SEP] Yummy?
Oshin? [SEP] Coming!
My book is missing. It was here this morning. [SEP] That 's odd. Maybe you misplaced it?
Kayo? [SEP] Forgive me. I didn 't mean to take it.
What do you expect of a peasant? [SEP] She craves what she doesn 't have. [SEP] Mother, we can 't have a thief in the house. It 's me, Oshin. Come in.
Oshin, you stole Kayo 's book. But you took it without asking. [SEP] Answer me! You took it!
As the dusk tide rolls in a plover squawks Though I 'm not a plover I 'd flap the wings of my heart And fly To a place that 's cold and miserable A young heart ls like a straight arrow I weep For there 's no consolation [SEP] That 's enough. You 're telling us the truth. [SEP] But Grandma! If you can read that well you 'd want to pick up a book and read a little. [SEP] Oshin. People view servants with prejudice. You 'd better be more careful.
It sounds nice. [SEP] Doesn 't it? [SEP] Did you buy it? [SEP] It was given to me. [SEP] By Whom?
Let me have it. Mother will pay you for it. [SEP] That harmonica is everything to me! Give it back. [SEP] I 'll pay you for it! [SEP] No! Not for all the money in the world! [SEP] Well then!
What have you done!
You wicked child! [SEP] Seitaro, don 't! [SEP] She 's just a kid. You can hit me all you want. [SEP] Oshin. Did you push Kayo? [SEP] What made you do that?
It was my fault. I 'm asking you why. [SEP] You wouldn 't do it for no reason.
Did you hurt your hand? [SEP] My suspicions weren 't unfounded. There 's a rumor that she was in hiding with a deserter. She 's not innocent.
Now I know that the rumor is true. You kept it secret so you could keep this job. [SEP] I 'm sorry that I hurt Miss Kayo. But don 't put down Shunsaku. He was a kind, gentle man. He taught me to read and write. He wasn 't a coward or a traitor. In war, friends and foes are killed. That 's why he quit.
Is Miss Kayo OK? [SEP] Don 't worry. She 'll be fine. [SEP] Oshin. I really wish you could stay but... I can 't undermine my son and his wife 's decision. [SEP] Kayo is a stubborn girl. You two don 't get along. It won 't go well for you.
I 've brought you some gruel. [SEP] Miss Kayo, how do you feel?
Welcome back, Madam. We started eating. [SEP] Seitaro. [SEP] It 's decided. The owner of the courier boat company will take Oshin. The rumors don 't bother him. Some people can judge for themselves. [SEP] Kayo! [SEP] Grandma, where are you sending Oshin?
She 's going to work for someone else. She can 't! You can 't kick her out! [SEP] Kayo? [SEP] She 's done nothing bad. I tried to force her to sell me her harmonica. [SEP] Kayo. It was my fault. Nobody has ever stood up to me! [SEP] Oshin wasn 't afraid of me.
I fought back! It was more like play fighting, so please! [SEP] Don 't kick her out. [SEP] Father, Mother, please! [SEP] Grandma, don 't make Oshin go away! [SEP] Kayo.
How about Oshin? [SEP] Oshin. [SEP] Thank you, ma 'am!
Oh, there you are! Happy new year! [SEP] Kayo! How you 've grown! [SEP] She 's still a kid inside.
Now we 'll be lucky! [SEP] Oh, you 're so drunk!
You 're cheeky! The things you say, girl. [SEP] What are those women?
Fuji, make me feel better. [SEP] Hands off! [SEP] Hey, how about me?
Do you know that woman? [SEP] Oshin? The love I feel for you makes me realize I 've never loved before... I got n! [SEP] You got it again, Miss Kayo. You 're so quick.
Were you with the Kagaya 's daughter? [SEP] They must be taking care of you. [SEP] I have nothing to worry about.
Oshin. That 's the thing about women. None of us work for our own benefit. They work for their parents, husbands and children. They can 't think of themselves. [SEP] That 's women for you. It 's the same with your Mama. She might have to do things for her family that you can 't blame her for. [SEP] Oshin. Love her with all your heart. She must have had it tough...
Leave this to us and go. [SEP] You don 't want your granny to die before you get there! [SEP] Where is the rice? [SEP] Coming!
Here 's my kimono. Wear this and go home. [SEP] Oshin, your grandmother is waiting for you.
Granny, I 'll get you some gruel. [SEP] Leave her alone. It will do no good. [SEP] Don 't be foolish!
Are you awake? You slept well. Your dad and the boys are making charcoal. [SEP] I 'll get your breakfast.
Alright, I 'm going to spray some rosewater. [SEP] Okay, take a deep breath.
It was making a running sound like even, even when it wasn 't, just when it was not in use. And then it would stop. [SEP] Okay, well did you look in the back. Like did you look in the tank of the toilet? [SEP] Mm-mm. Sometimes the chain just falls off. And you just reattach it. Is there, is there anything that I, I can... [SEP] No, everything is everything 's under to control.
Well, I mean you 're at my house every night. [SEP] Well, it 's not every night. I mean, rents really high right now, you know. I mean, it just makes sense. [SEP] Or, you could move in here until you find a place that 's suitable. There 's plenty of room, the door 's always open to you. [SEP] Thank you brother. That is a very generous offer Paul um... [SEP] Thank you. I mean it makes sense right?
That 's what I 'm saying. Right? [SEP] Yeah, I mean, you 're going to regret it though, because I 'm a complete and utter slob. Like I already don 't know that. I know but once all my stuff is there. Alright. [SEP] So you 'll move in. [SEP] Yeah. That 's great. [SEP] Why not. And you guys can have dinner at our house.
Dad? [SEP] Yeah, I was thinking, um. I think we need some new blood. [SEP] We could, could advertise. [SEP] That 's not, that 's too expensive. We have to, we have to spend money to make money right?
So, when was the last time you saw a Dentist? [SEP] About five years ago.
Okay, let 's open up and take a look. [SEP] Alright, what have we got going on here?
Is it warm enough in here? [SEP] It feels nice.
E3. Dad, he 's like totally freaking out. [SEP] Mirror. He loves you. He says you cured him. [SEP] Cured him of what? [SEP] Well, he had this horrible pain. It was in his jaw. [SEP] TMJ? Yeah. Temporomandibular Joint disorder.
Right, right. It was so bad that he had to stop singing. Since he 's left office and he 's had no pain. My grand-daughter has TMJ. Maybe you could cure her. [SEP] Well, that 's doubtful Mrs Olsen. But if she comes in, I 'd be happy to take a look. Let 's open please. Alright.
Oh... I hate to disappoint you, but if you came here hoping that I could somehow magically take away your pain, I can 't do that. [SEP] Okay. I understand. [SEP] Do you? Yes. Just do whatever you did for the last guy. The guy you cured.
And Abby came running in here, Grandpa Douglas had just mixed a batch of this... and everywhere it was all over his face. I was sitting right where you are and giggling and I mean... Oh my gosh, Look what else came. Look what you are doing for people. [SEP] I dont ', I don 't understand it. It 's not like I 'm doing anything differently. Henry 's singing again. [SEP] Well, that that 's great, but I 'm not responsible for that. He thinks you are.
Oh, hey Henry. Hey Jenny. [SEP] Did you come back to see my dad again? [SEP] Um, well, both of you actually. I um, wanted to give you tickets to my show. [SEP] Oh, oh wow, thank you. Um, it wouldn 't be happening if it weren 't for your dad. [SEP] That 's incredible. Thanks.
No, it 's just a little invite only thing. It 's no big deal. [SEP] No, that 's cool. We 'll definitely, definitely come. Cool um, I ah, I made this for you. [SEP] Oh, is this your music? [SEP] No, it 's just some songs that I thought you 'd like.
And um, how long have you had this pain? [SEP] Oh, for like, ever. That 's what if feels like at least. [SEP] Well it started in a kind of on and off way. Um, I was still working on the boat, so it was before 1998. [SEP] Right, right. And um, then it started to get real bad. And it 's right um, right in here? [SEP] It 's both sides. Both sides.
Both sides hurts. So that was before 1998 when it started and then ah...
What are these? [SEP] Ecstasy. [SEP] What? Are you taking that?
That tofu was so, I don 't usually like tofu and I just... [SEP] Oh thanks. I cooked it in like really special olive oil. So.
Welcome. Thank you. [SEP] So did you have a particular goal in mind for today?
Are you 're eyes closed? [SEP] Yep.
Pop your legs up on the couch. Just cross them over. Can you get that up there? [SEP] Stay still, stay still. Just don 't let go. Don 't let go. Just relax down a little bit.
So what we 're gonna do Dillon, in the first step is we 're just going to put some articulate... Are you ready? [SEP] Alright. One, two, three... How 's that feel? [SEP] Can you... Better? [SEP] I think it is.
Thank you so much. You 're welcome. [SEP] Thank you Oh you 're welcome.
See how that is. [SEP] Good. Looks good.
Hey in here? Scaller? Hello can you hear? I want my money back please. [SEP] This guy is a God-damn fraud. Fucking TMJ 's back. Hello are you here? [SEP] Be right back. I 'll be right back. [SEP] Hello? Yeah, hey buddy. Go ahead and do that there. Ah, he 's he 's Doctor He 's in the middle of a procedure. This guy 's a god-damn fraud. [SEP] Hello! Doctor. Oh there you are. You did not cure my TMJ.
Abby? [SEP] Hey. It 's Adrian. [SEP] Wow. Thought that was you. [SEP] Can I sit down?
Did it hurt? [SEP] I don 't know. That part I don 't remember.
What, what is that? [SEP] Go on in. Check it out. You might like it.
How long were you a messenger for? [SEP] Like five or six years. [SEP] Is that when you first got into like, like all the biking? [SEP] Yeah. It was just so much different then, just a different vibe. It was more my anarchist stage. [SEP] Anarchist cycling?
Yeah. I was just one angry dude. [SEP] That 's hard to imagine.
I 'm on my way asswipe! [SEP] How did you get out of there? [SEP] Where are you? Forget it. If you tell me where the key is I can just hide it for you. [SEP] I have the key, how many times must I tell you?! [SEP] When are they arriving?
The rat squad 'll be here within the hour. [SEP] Fine, get off my ass. I 'll be there soon, don 't touch my stuff. [SEP] So get here ASAP. [SEP] Got another call. [SEP] When will you be back?
The elders are upset that head of the family is gone. [SEP] I wouldn 't have left the funeral if it wasn 't serious.
Hey mister. [SEP] Mister.
Goddammit! EMERGENCY CALL SISTER [SEP] Yeah, what? [SEP] Daddy! Whatcha doing?
Evening. DUI checkpoint, sir. [SEP] DUI check. Evening, officer. [SEP] I... I 'm Western District Homicide Det. Ko Gun-su... Northern District officer Lee Dong-yun. [SEP] I see, thanks for your work. Keep at it, thanks bud. [SEP] Could you blow into this?
Evening, officer! [SEP] I 'm Western District Homicide Det. Ko. I had a sip at my mother 's funeral... Couldn 't I get a pass? [SEP] No ID, and he was acting suspicious. [SEP] Officer Lee, come on, man. What 's your ID number? [SEP] Come on, we 're all cops here.
So what 's your ID number?
How can you do this to fellow cops, goddammit! [SEP] Open this drawer. [SEP] Why so many locks on this? [SEP] Is Det. Ko here? [SEP] He 's mourning at the moment.
Hammer. [SEP] What 's inside? [SEP] He said to leave it.
You 're all fucked. [SEP] What the hell happened here?!
What brings you here past midnight? [SEP] You 're accusing a mourner over some money without context? [SEP] IAD isn 't run by humans? [SEP] We 're only following our orders. [SEP] Ship out. Come back after the funeral.
Don 't just stand there, pack up! This here is a list, of those who took bribes from local businesses. [SEP] I said pack up!
Hey, sweetie. Why aren 't you sleeping? [SEP] I already did. Where 's the cake?
Make room in the grave for us too. [SEP] I 'm sorry sir. [SEP] Chief... I 'm sorry, but could we do this later?
Wait... You want me to... take the heat for you all? While grieving? [SEP] What a fucking timing! [SEP] I 'm sorry, we really are. But we all can 't go down. This should end with you. [SEP] I 'll take care of you, so don 't worry. [SEP] Take care of me?! Cover your own ass! You 're not getting out of this! Even your brothel trips are on record!
'Ms. Autumn ' is your regular, right? Motherfucker, are you nuts?! [SEP] Yeah, fuckhead! I wish I was mental! [SEP] Fuck you man! Come at me!
My condolences. [SEP] Take care, sir.
Where are you going?! [SEP] Gun-su!
Sir, I 'd like some private moment with my mother one last time. [SEP] But... that 's rather unusual. [SEP] Okay. Until midnight. Thank you.
By the way, what 's that for? [SEP] These are for my daughter.
Please, not yet! [SEP] I 'm begging you! [SEP] Hang up! Please! I 'm so close! [SEP] Mom, mom, please, do something!
Why is this so heavy? [SEP] Careful, go slowly. Mother...
It 's pretty fast. [SEP] Mina, that 's enough, I 'm gonna get mad. IAD backed off quite easily. They confiscated the money and called it quits. We all went to great lengths to save your ass. [SEP] We 're the best, aren 't we? [SEP] Thank you, I 'll see you tomorrow. [SEP] Okay, I understand.
Mister, get out. [SEP] Are you drunk? [SEP] Good afternoon. Western District Det. Ko. [SEP] Why did you park on a right-turn lane? [SEP] You know better. This is a recently confiscated homemade C4, the explosive yield is tremendous, and can be remotely detonated. So desperate to make an impression on the new commissioner. Not too many reporters. It detonates 2 minutes after pushing this button. We 'll start the demonstration.
DEMONSTRATION OF I.E.D. We 'll also blow 4 societal evils as part of our campaign with the bomb. [SEP] Armed.
Fucking dog... Chief, maybe it was a prank call. [SEP] No, I can feel it. [SEP] Sir, I don 't think he 's here either. [SEP] Where is he then?
What the hell? No one 's here. [SEP] Dammit! Chief, take a look! [SEP] So he did live here. Maybe he got tipped off. Let 's look around for any evidence.
How 's the hit-and-run case? [SEP] The video quality is bad, and this must be the spot, but nothing yet. [SEP] Bad quality, huh? [SEP] Officer Lee. Yes, sir?
Are we still going away for the weekend? [SEP] For Mina 's birthday. [SEP] We are, I told you already. [SEP] Gun-su. I wanna talk about something, don 't be mad, okay? Can 't we kick out our shop tenant and open a toast shop there? [SEP] I 'm told snack shops do well there! I 'll pay the full rent!
We can 't kick them out before lease 's up. [SEP] But you 're a cop. [SEP] Cops aren 't gangsters! [SEP] Come on, let me. Please? [SEP] We can 't live off you forever.
By the way. What now! [SEP] Did mom have a man?
What 's wrong? Huh? Had a nightmare? [SEP] Were you napping? [SEP] We 've been hiking all day.
How can a cop be so bad at a chase? Did you give it a thought? Can we talk now? [SEP] I have a question. Okay. [SEP] How did you see me... burying Lee? It was pitch dark. [SEP] Dark? Doesn 't mean I can 't. [SEP] Let 's not get sidetracked.
You didn 't see it yourself. You don 't know where Lee is.
Answer the damn phone. [SEP] Dinner anyone? Western District... [SEP] Sure, I 'm friggin ' starving. One moment... He wants to report a car accident. [SEP] Then transfer to traffic. Hey, hey, hey!
Almost had a heart attack. [SEP] That 's Lt. Park?
There are 2 types of humans. One who lowers his tail before the alpha. And the one who tries hard after a beat. [SEP] Which one are you?
Bullet holes... [SEP] He was already dead?
Yo, Gwang-min! Why 's it so hard to reach you?! [SEP] I thought Lt. Park got to you already.
Asshole, I 'm not here for you! Let 's just chat! [SEP] Stop right there!
How did you end up like this? [SEP] Forget it, just drop it. I 'll confess back at the station, so let 's go. [SEP] I 'm really tired today. Whatever happens, I just wanna rest. [SEP] Rest? [SEP] You wanna rest?
Always so nonchalant. Manslaughter and disposal of body will get you near life. [SEP] Who cares about you, but your kid? [SEP] You drive me insane. [SEP] Absolutely insane.
Would I live comfortably with you locked up? [SEP] You got an interesting fate. [SEP] Your mother 's funeral is barely over, and now this? [SEP] Sang-ho. [SEP] Don 't thank me, I don 't wanna hear it. Help me. What now?! I 'm being blackmailed by a cop.
What 's this nonsense? [SEP] You know him. Park Chang-min. [SEP] I think he killed Lee too. [SEP] That corpse up there, that 's Lee. [SEP] You have to believe everything I tell you, okay? That night... I did hit someone.
How was the aim? The driver 's good eh? [SEP] Chatting up is all but over. Dig up Lee by 6 a.m.
Welcome home. [SEP] Hey. Mina 's sleeping.
Slow down now. [SEP] That 's far enough. Bring the body over.
Hold it, stay put. [SEP] Look what we got here? [SEP] Hold still asshole! Car key... Got anything else? [SEP] Well, look at this.
Still inside. [SEP] Those bullet holes, did you shoot him? [SEP] Yeah, about that. [SEP] Okay, I shot him, then bam! You ran him over. [SEP] So who killed him?
Yeah, I 'm on my way. What 's Mina doing? [SEP] Hold on. [SEP] Mina, it 's daddy. [SEP] Sweetie, it 's dad. [SEP] Did you eat your birthday breakfast?
Yes, I ate so much. While I 'm not there, be good to aunt and uncle. [SEP] Have all your meals, okay? [SEP] Okay. Get here fast, daddy. [SEP] Sure, sweetie. [SEP] Wait a little longer.
Daddy, bye! [SEP] Yeah, bye bye. [SEP] I love you, daddy! [SEP] When 's dad coming? Very soon.
Surprised? [SEP] I was too.
I understand how you feel, but life isn 't all about that. A year flies by when you 're relaxing in the country. Giving your severance to Choi 's mother is fine. [SEP] But what can you do besides being a cop? [SEP] There 're over 12,000 jobs in this country. I 'll find something. [SEP] With you gone, I got nobody! [SEP] Gun-su... Remember when you became a cop?
You had 1 adamant goal. [SEP] Retirement with full benefits. [SEP] Yeah, the ultimate goal of all civil servants. [SEP] Let 's not lose focus. [SEP] I 'll delay your resignation, so come back soon.
Sir, make a border of the mound, make it strong. So it can 't be dug up. It 's not a king 's tomb, no one will dig it up. Just make sure it 's strong and firm. [SEP] Your mother raised her children well. No one tends their parents graves this well nowadays. I 've noticed you before. [SEP] You 're a good son, a very good son. [SEP] Feels nice? " Good son. [SEP] With you out of work, how will we live now?
What a life... [SEP] Young-chul. Yes?
Yes! Trent: Damn it. That was supposed to be a bullet, not a staple. [SEP] What the hell?! Come on, guys! How are we gonna throw Frank 's birthday party in this mess? [SEP] Okay, look, I can explain.
Welcome to Stock Room. May I help you? [SEP] Yes. We were wondering if you might be able to tell us who bought this? [SEP] It 's a ball stretcher. [SEP] I 'm not very familiar with the inventory at the Stock Room. I only work here part time to raise money for my church to go to Europe and tour famous cathedrals. [SEP] You couldn 't have just applied for a job at Starbucks?
Oh no. My religion forbids me to be even near caffeine. [SEP] But it 's okay to work here?
The store must keep sales records. Would you mind if we take a quick peek? [SEP] I do not think the owner would approve. We would be happy to contribute to your trip. Wouldn 't we guys? [SEP] Wood, give her twenty bucks. Me? Why do I have to give her money? We know how much that stupid web cam show of yours makes? [SEP] No more free rides. Pay her. Fine. There you go. They keep the book in back. So I will take you there. Only one can come. Other two wait to see if owner come. [SEP] I 'll go. I 'll be back in a minute.
Come on you guys, this isn 't funny! [SEP] Hey guys? [SEP] Hey church girl. Where is everybody?
What the fuck is going on here? [SEP] Put this on! I thought I told you to wait outside! Get that shirt off! [SEP] Do not disobey Mistress Lena or you will be punished like your friends here. [SEP] Mistress Lena? Really? What 's with the outfit and the voice? [SEP] I can 't believe you feel for that meek Asian stereotype.
It proves that you are a racist pig. You 've got to be kidding me. Do I look like I 'm kidding? [SEP] Stop. Stop. Please stop. I will stop when I am ready to stop! Get down! Oh, don 't worry Sasquatch. I didn 't forget about you. It 's kind of like Wheel of Fortune, isn 't it? Except there 's no fortune and I can zap your nutsuck whenever I feel like it.
Does your church group know that you talk like this? They probably don 't like it. [SEP] Did I say you could speak? Get down! [SEP] This has all been really very entertaining and strangely elaborate. [SEP] I didn 't know we were in for this. [SEP] We 're not into the whole BDSM thing, okay? We are just here for some information from your books.
All right. How about this? Two of you can go look at my books if one of you will stay and take this.
And now, the continuation of Hell 's Kitchen. The doors have not yet opened for dinner service. [SEP] Gina, what 's going on? [SEP] Um, I can 't function. And Gina is already feeling the pressure. I 'm sorry that I 'm doing this, but...
I just needed a rest. And I 'm gonna bounce back really fast. [SEP] All right, Jacqueline, so what did I miss? [SEP] What 'd you miss? You missed everything. [SEP] All right, ladies. Let 's go.
All of you, taste that. It 's too spicy, and it 's disgusting. [SEP] Trash. And again, scallops cooked beautifully. [SEP] What the is going on? [SEP] It 's like deja vu in this. [SEP] How many times have you cooked scallops tonight and not served them?
Twice, chef. Sorry, bro. [SEP] Sebastian, get it together!
Seriously, slice the lamb. [SEP] How long does it really take? [SEP] How much of an amateur are you? [SEP] Where 's the lamb? [SEP] Just cut through it, babe. Cut through it.
I 'm trying. [SEP] Oh, my God, this bitch is cutting lamb for 6 hours now. Bitch, there 's only 24 hours in a day. I want that lamb now.
It 's just over an hour into Hell 's Kitchen 's opening night, and the blue team has failed to deliver a single entree to the dining room. [SEP] How much longer could it be? [SEP] And the unwelcome return of Sebastian... [SEP] Chef, can I please come back, chef? [SEP] You. You come here, you.
Has pushed chef Ramsay to the limit. [SEP] You, for the last time, take him and him and get out! [SEP] And let me tell you something. You come back downstairs again, you 'll be leaving through the front door. Now get out! Yes, chef. Three of you.
After a rough dinner service where almost the entire team was kicked out of the kitchen, the men have made a tough decision. We have nominated Jeremy. [SEP] But they are not done yet. [SEP] Second nominee and why? [SEP] Our second nominee is... Sebastian.
Sebastian, seriously? You want to around in the middle of service? Why did you come in here? [SEP] I love cooking. This is something I love to do, and I 've been... I 've put in my time. [SEP] Today. I know I dropped the ball. It 's just sometimes my personality comes out in the kitchen. [SEP] Before I came here, I knew one of my biggest problems, one of my biggest challenges, is my attitude. And it 's something I have to correct. [SEP] Jeremy. You 're one of the youngest in this competition.
I thought you were in way over your head. [SEP] Why do you think you should stay in Hell 's Kitchen?
Next time on Hell 's Kitchen... The women celebrate their win... The red team, congratulations. By having an all-out war. If you want to argue, just press the bell, bitch. [SEP] Don 't call me bitch. You crazy. [SEP] Don 't call me crazy. I said, " bitch, you crazy and deranged. The teams try a bonding exercise. Backs up against the wall. Get down, break it up. [SEP] Careful. Stop pushing. But there 's a shocking departure. Pack your stuff, and leave Hell 's Kitchen. And will an explosive dinner service... Let 's go, then, we 're still serving... communication! [SEP] Get some momentum!
Push one chef... Have you got a drinking problem? [SEP] Too far? I mean, this is harder than hard. All next time on a truly dangerous... You may have to go to the hospital.
Oh, man. Tigress is right. How 's Dad gonna feel when I give him this? [SEP] You 're no son of mine. [SEP] Oh, man. Dad deserves more than my lousy homemade spoon. I got to get him something better. Tigress and Xiao Niao, I need you to wrap up some little presents I got for everyone. Yay! I love helping. [SEP] Don 't you love wrapping presents? It 's so creative. [SEP] We are not going to get along.
Come on. Don 't you want to go back to Chor Ghom? [SEP] I hear they 're putting in a swimming pool!
Oh, where is he? [SEP] It 's not like Po to be late for the winter feast. Or really any food-related event.
If only my father was here to see it. [SEP] Okay, your name is Shu Fen, and you 're a traveling ladder salesman from Hubei, whose caravan was destroyed by a tornado outside... Po, what is all this for? Because I 'm sneaking you in. [SEP] Why? To see your daughter.
Um... so how did the Tang Yuan turn out? [SEP] Not too gluey?
Hey, don 't not forget, you got to be my house tonight, at seven for dinner. Mob Wives " is at eight. there will be me, Wyatt, Randy and another Randy Buck and Andrew. Looks like what you have with you is an embarrassment to " bitch ". [SEP] You proud of it are, huh? [SEP] If it was a ceremony, I already have my speech prepared. [SEP] Ok, first, it is very offensive. Secondly, I love, I will use and it comes from me. And thirdly, be there at 19h. I could not be there. [SEP] What? How do you mean you can not be there! This is the new season, you 're always there.
Twenty-eight. Ooh-hoo-hoo. [SEP] Twenty-nive. Oh, it burns.
You have to help me break up with Milena. [SEP] What? Why? You 're her little Dannichka. She 's getting too serious. I mean, I like her, but I 'm not ready to commit. And I don 't wanna lead her on. [SEP] So can 't you just talk to her? [SEP] I 've tried, but there 's something about her. It 's like she has these powers. [SEP] Powers? Like making your clothes disappear?
No. I start to say one thing, then she kisses me, and I forget what I 'm talking about. [SEP] Oh, how much more rational men would be with just one extra pint of blood. Will you help me? [SEP] You 've been dumped a ton of times. [SEP] Not that many times. [SEP] Johnny, Teddy, Big-hair Bobby- Okay, thank you. Point made.
Hey, is that my Nana 's ring? How do you notice a little nondescript diamond ring, and you didn 't notice that I cut my hair? [SEP] Oh, yeah. It looks really good. Two years ago. Wheeler, let 's focus. My advice is you gotta tell her the truth. And I think the sooner the better. [SEP] Danny? You want to join me in shower? [SEP] Sure. I think this will be easier if I 'm clean.
What just happened? How could she think I wanted to get married? [SEP] I 'm just guessing, but it might have been the whole on-bended-knee thing. [SEP] We can 't get married. [SEP] I 'm too young to get married. [SEP] Really? That 's your takeaway from this? Now remember, what happens on the elevator... Stays on the elevator.
Gesundheit. [SEP] I can 't believe it. Look what Danny gave me. [SEP] Milena! Hey! Don 't bother the nice lady. Come quick. Danny needs to see you.
Say " Aloha. [SEP] Aloha!
Eva, Dag, welcome! Thank you. You look lovely. Good treatment? [SEP] What a feast! Open your heart and it 's easy to open your door. [SEP] Are we here to celebrate your new personality? [SEP] No. We are here to celebrate that part of my personality has come back to life. Cheer and welcome. Cheers. As Saint-Exupéry says: Only with the heart can on see rightly. Love of life, Dag. Rarely is someone so destroyed as when they base their happiness on a foundation of fleeting emotions. [SEP] Fantastic. The more bitter you are, the happier it makes me.
You look as pleased as a freshly-fucked cat. On the contrary. I actually decided to stop having sex. [SEP] Huh? Say what? [SEP] Nothing good has come from me having sex, except my son. I 've been jumping from vagina to vagina like a toad of water lilies. Every time you think you can rest, they sink. So no more sex, no more chaos. [SEP] So true. Yeah. [SEP] Has everyone helped themselves?
You didn 't tell him about the penis? [SEP] Nope, Maybe we should? [SEP] You haven 't known each other long
You don 't know each other inside and out, as it were? [SEP] This feels right, and that 's enough. But...
Congratulations. This is wrong. He 'll find out eventually. [SEP] OK, come on. I know where he is. [SEP] Excuse us. We 'll be right back. Everything 's fine.
You have some serious gender issues. [SEP] Of course I will. Should I ask Leon if he wants to be a bridesmaid? [SEP] I 'm sure he 'd love to see his dad get married. And see how great you look in your gown. [SEP] Where have you been? Discussing life. [SEP] Where is Benedikt? Isn 't he with you?
He must have stayed behind. Come on, don 't stop now! Speaking of penises... Dammit, no!
That 's why I lock my door. [SEP] Has life always been this chaotic? Not when I was alone. [SEP] Without me? Without any humans at all. You know it 's you and me now, Dag? Yes. Thank God. [SEP] And that doesn 't make you nervous? Not in the least. [SEP] Will we stay together forever?
Without a doubt in my mind. [SEP] How can you be so sure? Anything else would be pointless.
You Nazi whore! Come back here! [SEP] Shave the German tart 's head! [SEP] Come back here! Where did she go? [SEP] Find that German-loving whore! Shave her head!
Sleep tight, my boy. [SEP] I love you, Alexander.
Is Benedikt here? [SEP] Benedikt? No, he 's a little busy. Why? [SEP] He has to drive us.
What 's up? Good morning. [SEP] Is it? Yes, the best one in a long time. I was thinking, after dinner last night... Coffee? [SEP] Yes, please. Here you go. Thanks. [SEP] What is that? This is a chart over our new routine. OK... As I view it, you and I are a perfect match. The only problem is that we both like time to ourselves. [SEP] That is a challenge. So I have divided the rooms in the apartment into specific times. I eat breakfast alone, then you eat breakfast alone. We take turns in the bathroom, take turns watching Leon. And we have two hours of quality time nightly. We can use that for a movie, TV, sex, or listening to an album. Thereby feeling comfortably alone while in the same apartment. We 'll get more spare time and look forward to meeting every evening,
You 're a cohabitational genius. I know. It 's my job. [SEP] Control yourself, Miss. My breakfast time starts now. Hold that thought for tonight. I 'll wake up Leon in a half-hour. And the nun has left. She 's on her way to Benedikt and Mecca.
Doesn 't look so bad. [SEP] Let me know when you wanna switch. Philip... Go home. [SEP] We both need rest.
I 'm so sorry. Thank you. He was just... What? [SEP] Just the other night, he was... He was asking me out again, that 's all. After he... That man, he could drive a woman crazy, you know? [SEP] Yeah, he sure could. He was very fond of you, Martha. [SEP] Me too. Agent Gaad wants to see you in the vault. Would you excuse me?
Anything on the ring? Not yet. Have a seat. It wasn 't on his body, it wasn 't in his apartment. He always wore the ring. If it 's out there, we 'll find it. [SEP] Well, it is out there. Sit. Look, I know that the Rezident was the target, but if we don 't hit these guys...... when they start killing our men... Stan, no one 's accusing you of anything. I 'm on your side. We 're in a war now. It may be a secret war, but it 's a war. We have to fight like soldiers now. And you 're one of our best. [SEP] Well, it doesn 't feel like it tonight. I don 't imagine it does, no. But in war, blood gets spilled. That 's how it goes. [SEP] So don 't think twice about what you did. Understand? Now, go home. Get some rest. [SEP] I 'd rather stay and work the case, sir.
The entire Bureau is working the case. If anything breaks, I 'll let you know. Tomorrow morning, signal your source, see what the hell she knows about Amador. Now go. That 's an order.
You up for a nightcap? Sure. Come on in. [SEP] How...? How did you know I was here? [SEP] If I can 't find a travel agent staying at a motel under his own name then I 'm in the wrong line of business. [SEP] Elizabeth told Sandra. [SEP] Right, right.
Well, make yourself comfortable. I 'll throw on some sweats.
No offense, Phil, but this place is kind of depressing. [SEP] Yeah, I know. It 's a shit hole. [SEP] Well, it 's temporary. [SEP] Yes, it is. Everything is. [SEP] Everything is what?
Temporary. [SEP] I 'll drink to that. [SEP] Can I have one of those? Sure. [SEP] Cheers. Cheers. You know, I spent a lot of time in shitty motel rooms like this. You know that? [SEP] I did not.
Yeah, before. Before, when I was working undercover. No matter what city I was in, it was pretty much the same room. [SEP] Lumpy bed, right? Right. [SEP] Yeah, too soft. It sags in the middle. Yeah. You would think they would spring for a decent bed. [SEP] I guess that 's kind of the point, right? No matter where you are, no matter what city or town you 're always in the same place. The same shitty room.
My partner was found dead tonight. [SEP] Oh, Jesus. I am so sorry. Chris Amador. He was a good guy. [SEP] Not like me. He was never married. Maybe that was it. [SEP] What? He had no secrets, you know? You can 't be married and not have secrets can you, Phil?
You okay? Yeah, yeah. I 'm all right. You can stay here if you want. [SEP] In your lumpy bed? No. No thank you. I was actually thinking the chair. [SEP] That 's worser. [SEP] No, I don 't... I don 't see a whole lot of future in my sleep tonight.
Who killed Amador? [SEP] Who killed Amador? Yeah. [SEP] Who killed Vlad? [SEP] I don 't know. Don 't lie to me. I 'm not lying, Nina. Jesus. Vlad is my friend. My friend. [SEP] I 'm sorry you lost your partner. I am. I lost my friend.
This is a really bad day, yes? [SEP] Yes, it 's a very bad day. But I need to know what happened, Nina. We had no idea what was going on. We don 't kill FBI agents. You have to believe... [SEP] Well, three of my men were killed protecting a scientist two weeks ago. [SEP] Yes, and that day I told you, Arkady was behind closed doors. I told you something was going on. But yesterday, nothing. [SEP] Really? Nothing. Nothing until somebody called threatening to kill Vlad if something happened to your partner. Next thing, the police call, saying he 's been murdered in a mugging.
What are we to think? [SEP] I don 't know who killed Vlad, Nina - If I can find out, I 'll let you know.
Clark had a talk with Martha last night. And? [SEP] Amador wore a ring. Apparently, it wasn 't on his body. We swept the safe house. Yeah. And Gregory 's team swept the car. We were all moving pretty fast. [SEP] You have any idea where they ditched it? [SEP] I 'll signal Gregory and have him get into it. Feds are gonna push this as far as they know how. I 'll make sure he knows to lay low until we know what 's what. [SEP] Stan came by the motel last night, a drunk mess.
What did you find out? [SEP] That his partner was killed. I couldn 't exactly work him for leads. You were the one who wanted to be his friend, right? [SEP] What a great potential source he could be? [SEP] Okay. Call next time, all right? I don 't need permission to see my kids. [SEP] Fine. Stay. Clean the kitchen while you 're at it.
Paige, Henry.
The ring you tried to pawn belonged to a federal agent. Look, I don 't ask questions and sometimes people leave things. It 's a fair trade. The federal agent in question was murdered. So I 'm gonna ask questions and you 're gonna answer them. Sound okay? [SEP] Yeah. Good. Who delivered the car and when? [SEP] It was left here, last night. I didn 't see anyone. [SEP] They just left it? Some people do. They know that I sell the metal... The ring was in the trunk? [SEP] You got the keys?
I want to ask you again. [SEP] Who dropped off this car? Look, like I already told you...
You listen to me, you piece of shit. You may think you know what I am or what I will and won 't do in this situation but you have no idea. I don 't believe someone who murdered a federal agent will dump their car at some random salvage yard. So I want you to tell me everything you know about this. Do you understand? There 's some black guys they 're drug dealers, I think. They dump cars with me sometimes. They came by late last night. [SEP] I don 't know their names. I swear to God. [SEP] See? That wasn 't so bad, was it? You and I are gonna go look at some mug books together.
Hey How bad is it? We don 't know. The guy may have left his ring behind in the trunk. [SEP] Damn. Yeah. We 'll let you know what we know. Stay safe and out of sight till this thing goes away.
We all will be. [SEP] You included. This thing, it 's gonna blow over. We 're just trying to get ahead of it. [SEP] And if it doesn 't blow over? [SEP] Let 's not cross that bridge unless we have to. In the meantime, you just stay out of sight, check your signals.
You know, I only have one real question for you, Curtis. Which is, do you have any idea what it is that you 've been doing? [SEP] Because if you do know, then keep your mouth shut. [SEP] That 's how bad it is. But if you don 't know, if you 've somehow kind of been tricked into this well, you might wanna speak up. You 've been arrested twice minor drug raps. I work in Counter Intelligence. Do you know what that is? I 'm not saying anything to you. [SEP] I chase spies. The KGB. You ever heard of them? [SEP] That 's the Russians.
You know what I don 't care about? [SEP] Drugs. I couldn 't care less. I may look dumb, but I 'm not. [SEP] You don 't look dumb. Cops got all kinds of tricks. You know, my partner was killed two nights ago. I 'm way past tricks, Curtis. His name was Chris Amador. And he was stabbed.
Philip and Elizabeth said you 'd be expecting me. [SEP] Claudia. Gregory - it means a lot to meet you, Gregory. Please, let 's sit. We have to move quickly but we want to make sure we 're doing everything to make this as easy as possible.
I won 't take to Moscow. [SEP] It takes time, but others have done it. You 'll like it, eventually. [SEP] I never wanted too much, really. I just wanted to live for something. And I 've done that. [SEP] Okay. And to know when I 'm done. Now I 'm done.
You tell him how lovely Moscow is in the spring? [SEP] Some people just aren 't cut out for foreign travel. [SEP] You think he 's negotiating? Trying to soften you up for California? [SEP] He 's trying to get away from us, or he 's fooling himself. I don 't know. But we need to get him to Moscow, Philip. And if he won 't go? [SEP] He was Elizabeth 's first recruit, her agent. I 've had my differences with her but if this ends the hard way, I don 't want her to have to do it.
You 'll be there? Of course.
That 's why I fell for you. [SEP] Because I 'm a tough girl?
You 're committed uncompromising and stubborn. You like all that? [SEP] Don 't take him back. Find somebody else. He 's gonna soften you all up. [SEP] Gregory... Hey. Find somebody that will love you for being so strong.
Goodbye, Elizabeth. Gregory. Look who 's here. He won 't come. Wants to find some cops to shoot him. Thinks that 'll end things for us. [SEP] For us? [SEP] True to the end. Come on, Gregory. You owe me this much. Wait outside, Elizabeth. Gregory, please. I 'm done talking. [SEP] Elizabeth, wait outside. [SEP] No. You don 't have to do this.
Seasoned crooks swear you only remember two days about your stretch in jail: The day you get in... [SEP] Oh, boy.... and the day you get out. But I 'll tell you, those guys, they never been to a Polish prison. 'Cause, buddy, you don 't forget a second of your stay in the Warsaw penal system.
Oh, boy. And you never stop thinking about what you done that got you there, and what you 're going to do when you get out. And who you 're going to do it to. I reckon it takes a betrayal before you realize the real currency in the world ain 't money... it 's trust. [SEP] Hey. So, guess I 'm topsies, huh? 'Cause if you got no trust...
Boys, let 's all split up! [SEP] Train to Berlin. Ten AM. Bright and early like!
Ladies and gentlemen, let 's give old Crunch a moment of silence as he prepares to go down, down, down into the ring of fire! [SEP] How 'd she do? Tell me at least a thousand.
Excuse me, sir. Would you consent to a voluntary search? [SEP] Right this way, please. Bad luck, chief.
Crunch, honey, we 're out of ice. [SEP] Oh yeah, all right. [SEP] Thank you, Crunchie. Adios, fellas. [SEP] Ice? $ 50 for ice? It 's wintertime. Crunch, she 's, she 's not even trying anymore. [SEP] Happy wife, happy life, right? So you say.
Oh, I don 't know, Francie. When I was a young buck I thought I 'd make history, not just sit there reading about it. Hell, I thought I 'd be a great man.
Oh, easy, man! Where 's your fuckin ' brother? [SEP] I was gonna cut bait and go home then I realized Nicky said he had a brother.
What the fuck? What 's going on? [SEP] Nicky 's back. What? [SEP] And so am I. What the fuck just happened? [SEP] Fate! Fate is what just happened. [SEP] Uncle Paddy.
How are you, lad? Still in the land of the living? [SEP] You wanted to know when I was ready to go back to work.
You must be Francie, are ya? [SEP] Paddy McCarthy. But for you, it 's Uncle Paddy. [SEP] So, is there a donnybrook a-brewin' in there? How she gettin ' on? [SEP] I understood the word " Francie ". [SEP] Fightin ', are they? Ha. So much alike those two. They 're literally nothing alike. Oh, different mothers. They grew up on different sides of the country. Their father was the Johnny Appleseed of sperm.
That 's revolting. You 're gettin ' old, Crunch. You never used to be that easy. [SEP] Look, if it 's an apology you need to put this thing to bed... An apology? You sent me to prison, man. [SEP] Exactly. I owe you one.
Well, you 're shittin ' me, right? First off, I ain 't ever heard of this Gospel According to Jimmy. And number two, we 're not equipped to rob an international border station. [SEP] Look! There 's guards. There 's cameras everywhere. [SEP] This would take months of planning and skill sets we just don 't possess! [SEP] Forget it! We 're not the A-Team here, guys. I 'd peg us at a D-minus for this kind of thing. [SEP] I thought you had something, Paddy. I 'm out. Hey, Crunch... Leave him, lad. I got him.
All right. I 'll do it. But this one we do my way. [SEP] What did ya have in mind?
Call me Ponch. [SEP] I 'm Nicky. Paddy. Francie. Crunch. Those are some shitty aliases. Y 'all sound like chocolate bars. [SEP] Where 's Twix? [SEP] Oh, wait. Crunch Calhoun? [SEP] No! Dude. I once saw you almost jump six cars in Buffalo. Changed my life. Listen, the Reverend said that you could help us out for 10,000. Tempting, but not a chance. No. I told the Reverend everything I know for twice that. And I got so sick from nerves I didn 't eat, shit or sleep for a week. I 'm not your guy. If you were our guy.
If I were your guy, I 'd go about forgetting it. There 's 12 cameras, 12 of them. That 's one dozen cameras. [SEP] Any in the storage room? No, but everywhere else. Three guards, backup generator. It 's impossible. [SEP] I don 't accept that. Well, accept it, Snickers. There 's always a way. All right, look. I 'll tell you what I told the Reverend, OK? [SEP] That we called an expert. She comes in Saturday at 10. [SEP] Don 't call me again.
OK, you want to throw things? Throw things, OK! [SEP] I don 't give a shit! Motherfuck! [SEP] OK. OK. No, be careful with that. No, don 't do that, OK? I want to see the piece of paper that says you can go through that! [SEP] No, don 't touch it. That is $ 2,000... He 's clean. First Nicky, then Paddy, now Guy. I 'm telling you, something 's up. This is bullshit! And you know it and you know it! I thought we had a 10-32. [SEP] Ten thirty-two? You trying to impress me with numbers?
I 'll give you an impressive number: 52. That 's the number of millions they said I stole. I got a number for you: one, as in you help me land this one and you 're out. On the lives of my kids. I 've seen your kids. You 'd be better off without them. You 're a cunt. You wouldn 't know a vagina if it was four foot tall and staring you in the face. [SEP] I 'm gonna punch you in the fucking... Aw, shit. Interpol. Interpol?!
Crunch. Sam? [SEP] Men of our vintage should be retired. You know, when I heard you were working for the other side, I just couldn 't believe it. At least tell me they don 't make you wear a wire. [SEP] No. They don 't make me wear a wire. And I get to see some fine art. [SEP] So... what do you think they 're talking about down there? [SEP] Still about the art, huh?
My mother got me into it. We were always hard up, but she did her best. Worked as a barmaid between kids. When I was ten or 11, she took me to the V and A in London. And I saw an object that blew my mind. It was a drinking cup fashioned from a single piece of jade. It was just a cup, but it was perfect. And it made me look at everything differently. [SEP] Turner, Monet, Vermeer, those guys kept my eyes open. It was a feeling I had, a completeness when art touched me. I only started getting into trouble when I wanted to possess it. [SEP] And you... what makes you do it? [SEP] Money. [SEP] Well, at least you 're honest. It 's always nice to know... who you can trust.
I 'm gonna find this painting. Not because I want to get you or your brother in trouble. I just want to hold it. Let me ask you a question. You ever seen the inside of Sing-Sing? [SEP] I haven 't. ' Cause I know a lot of guys who would like to fuck you inside there. [SEP] Are you hitting on me?
Let 's roll! [SEP] Just, uh, try to act natural. [SEP] Yeah. I, I don 't know what that means.
Saturday, ten AM. Guy walks into the border station. [SEP] And, man, will you please wear a suit? [SEP] No offense, but you look like a slutty elf.
Yeah, where 're we at? I got Guy on the other line. [SEP] OK, I 'm in. How will I know where it is? [SEP] It 's pink and three feet tall. You 're a Frenchman, you 'll find it.
Like Ponch said, with no security cameras in the room, Guy can make the switch. [SEP] All right. We got an hour to go. [SEP] Did you get the nylons? I did indeed. [SEP] One? Well, it says one pair. [SEP] One pair? Like a pair of pants. Yeah.
Well, I 'm sorry, Mr. Condescending, I don 't buy a whole lot of fuckin ' pantyhose. [SEP] Fishnets? Yes. Put these over our heads we 'll look like a couple of waffles.
Yeah? Finished. [SEP] All right, Crunch, you 're up.
No. Something 's not right. [SEP] OK, here we go. What are you doing? [SEP] This is usually how it works. Perps go on the move, cops get moving. A little pro tip for you: perps ", short for perpetrators. Just trust me for a second. Don 't switch the engine on.
Now you take a bow, Guy. Moi? [SEP] Four days to fake a 500-year-old masterpiece. [SEP] Oh, to have your talent, lad. It was an inspired effort. I admit. But I am no Yves Chaudron. [SEP] Who 's that, Yeeves Show-row? [SEP] Stay, Crunch. You 'll like this.
Nah, I 've heard this tale a time or two. I gotta take a piss. Come on, Crunch. [SEP] Wait. Who 's Yves Shmo-boh?
Ohhh, fuck. [SEP] Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I, I taste an ashtray and battery acid and, like, stripper perfume. [SEP] So, we headed for Detroit? Finish things up with the Reverend, or what? [SEP] Yeah, that 's right. We all just pile into the car like the Brady Bunch and just breeze on into the States, right? [SEP] They already flagged me for coming over here.
Yeah, me too. Me too. They don 't like me a lot either, so... what exactly is your plan? [SEP] Well, we need someone with a clean sheet. Francie, you 're up.
Really? Why am I wearing this shit? [SEP] Because Interpol knows what you look like. [SEP] OK, but don 't the Amish ride horse and carriages? [SEP] Well, you 're progressive. I can 't fucking do this! [SEP] Well, you better get your best Brando on, hoss, ' cause we need you.
Yeah, look, Francie, it 's not The King 's Speech. Come here. You got two lines: Going to Detroit. " And " Nothing to declare. [SEP] You 're gonna be great. [SEP] I 'll meet him there. Oh. Will you? [SEP] Yeah. Hey, look, somebody 's got to be in Detroit to close the deal with the Reverend. Nicky, I 'm goin ' with ya. We 're both hiding in the trunk. The trunk? [SEP] I 'm not hidin ' in a trunk.
Well, then no one 's going to Detroit. 'Cause if you 're alone when you get your digits on that money, we 'll never see you again. [SEP] All right, man. Fine. Pop it, Francie. [SEP] What are you doing? Yeah, what are you doing? [SEP] Hopefully, you won 't have to know. [SEP] Yes, sir. But if you just give me...
Sir, we are so very close on this. We just... [SEP] No, I realize I 'm not supposed to be in the field, but that 's not the...
OK. OK, Francie. I got an idea. I think we can make a lot more money off that Gospel. [SEP] Hold out for more from the Reverend? [SEP] No, we don 't even deliver it to him. [SEP] OK. I fail to see how that makes us rich. Guy telling that story about the Mona Lisa got me thinking. There 's a real parallel here. [SEP] Great. Parallel. Not interested.
Listen, don 't dismiss the idea out of spite. Not interested. Hear me out! [SEP] Uncle Paddy can come up with at least ten more buyers. And we can get Guy to duplicate a book for each one of them. We contact the gallery, we let them know their book is stolen. The news hits the paper and boom. Meanwhile we ship off ten copies to ten buyers. Each one thinks they have the original. [SEP] Goddamn it if it 's not perfect. You know... I think we could make half a mil per book. [SEP] No, you know, twice that. You know how much that is? Ten million.
Uh, all right, boys. We 're here so just be quiet, OK? [SEP] Just be cool! Two lines! Going to Detroit! Nothing to declare!
All right, what is this place? [SEP] His office is on the third floor. I think he paid like three grand for the whole place. [SEP] He overpaid.
A million per book. Ten million bucks, guys. [SEP] You interested? Of course, I 'm fucking interested. [SEP] Wonderful. Uncle Paddy? [SEP] Ten buyers, I can find. Maybe more. [SEP] No, no, no. Let 's stick with ten. Let 's not get greedy here.
Guy, when can you get started? Today. Now. It will take me maybe three weeks... No, one month. I just need money. OK, 100 grand, that 's covered.
I know what you want. [SEP] Good. ' Cause you 're gonna need to talk to him. He will never give you all that money. [SEP] No, but he 'll give it to you. [SEP] To me? He trusts you. And we 're gonna be wiring money all over the world. You 're the only one that 's not on any watch list. [SEP] Francie isn 't. Francie hasn 't taken a bath in six weeks. Come on.
Can you convince him?
Ah, you waste no time. [SEP] What can I say? I 'm excited. [SEP] OK. Great, we 're all here.
Truly breathtaking, it is. [SEP] Oh, bloody hell. Hey, Midge. How you fixed for quarters? [SEP] Dirty Ernie. Hey, Nicky! Give us a hug! I 'm not a big hugger, Ernie. [SEP] Huh. Midge, go take a walk. I 'll see you at the hotel. Now watch it, Ernie. The hookers in this town aren 't the cleanest.
Yeah, what? Yeah. Hi, Reverend. It 's Nicky Calhoun. [SEP] What? Nicky Calhoun? [SEP] What are you doin ' callin ' me? [SEP] Listen, I just wanted to let you know that we 've got your book and just wanted to give you a heads up, there 's a slight delay. Delay? Right. With the delivery time. It might take a month or so. Look, I don 't know what the fuck you 're talking about. Don 't call me again. Listen, I 'm gonna come see you and we can discuss it then. How 's that?
I think he paid, like, three grand for the whole place. [SEP] Why is it I 've not heard that such as famous book as yours was nicked? [SEP] Paddy, come on. Just listen to the story, before you say no, lads. There 's a good moral to this story. Paddy McCarthy here. Leave me a message... Fuck! [SEP] The special Gospel. Last month, at the Vanderloos Gallery... I 'd like to report a theft. I don 't understand. [SEP] We 're not the police.
No, no, no. It 's a book in your collection. A Gospel printed by the Gutenberg Press. [SEP] Yeah. I think you are mistaken. [SEP] No, no, no. It 's the Gospel According to James and it 's a fake. Check it out. I can 't do that. [SEP] Why not? We are sculpture museum. We have no books or paintings. We have only sculpture. The Reverend 's got somebody on the inside. We have an expert coming in on Saturday. Paddy, get us a name. [SEP] We 're sorry. The number you have reached is not in service.
Later, Crunch! There 's gotta be like... [SEP] Fuck!... ten experts in the country they could have called. Olga Something-Long. [SEP] Hello? It 's Nicky Calhoun. Have you... Have you seen Paddy? [SEP] What? Did you fuckin ' see Paddy? [SEP] He left a couple of days ago.
What about the Gospel? Did Customs ask you to look at the Gospel? [SEP] Gospel? The fuckin ' Gospel According to James! [SEP] Did they ask you to look at it?
And that is the story of the theft of the Mona Lisa. You just took five and half of the best years of my life away, Nicky. Nicky Boy, you 'll pay the piper for what you did to Dennis. I 'll see to it meself. [SEP] I 'll take care of the Reverend. I 'll call you with his number. [SEP] Yeah? Nicky, want the Reverend 's number?
Please leave a message. [SEP] Lola, pick up the phone. Call me! We got a problem!
What painting? The Seurat. [SEP] Whoa. Whoa. What? [SEP] The Georges Seurat, you ignorant fuck. The seminal post French " Impressionalisht ". The father of fucking... Fuck! [SEP] The seminal founder of " Post-Impressionalism ". The father of pointillism. Seminal French
That was quick. Is everything okay? [SEP] Oh, yeah. I need a minute. I was getting inside my head.
Hey, have you heard anything? [SEP] It 's, like, 3: 00. How long does it take them to make these decisions? [SEP] Danny promised we 'd know by the end of the day. [SEP] Well, isn 't there a table read on Monday? [SEP] Glenn? Hmm?
What did you think? [SEP] It 's really rare to get to watch a film while the filmmaker is sitting right there watching you.
Thank you again for watching that. [SEP] I really appreciate the feedback.
Hi, I 'm so sorry. Hey. I got caught up talking and I completely lost track of time. [SEP] Oh, don 't worry about it. No, please, yeah, come in. Make yourself... what are you drinking? [SEP] I 've recently dabbled in scotch, so maybe a scotch? [SEP] Sure, yeah. Yeah? [SEP] Better late than never. I 'm gonna put on some tunes.
Oh, please do. Get this party started.
I don 't know. Maybe she 's right. [SEP] Maybe it is overwrought. Maybe I 'm not a good actor or a writer. [SEP] I have all these ambitions, but honestly, what if I 'm just not good enough? Don 't worry about her, okay? Think she 's having as much fun as you are right now? I mean, what does she even mean by " overwrought "? [SEP] It 's not overwrought. It 's passionate. [SEP] Why is she criticizing me for trying to do something that 's honest and raw?
Don 't work yourself up about it, okay? It 's only a web series. No one 's ever gonna see it. I mean... I didn 't mean no one 's gonna see it.
Is the gratuity included in the $ 185? [SEP] No, sir. No? Great. This steak looks fantastic.
Stuart? [SEP] Hey. Hey. So, uh... I 'm gonna take off, but I just wanted to say sorry for last night, and thanks. [SEP] You were really sweet. [SEP] Don 't worry about it. It 's fine. It was a bit weird with Paul here, I know, and I was a bit drunk. He left and he, like, didn 't even say bye. [SEP] Really? Yeah. I have the worst taste in men.
Hausner could have avoided talking nonsense. In his book, Justice in Jerusalem, he writes about two Jewish Elders who were the " tools or marionettes " of the Germans. One of them was Rumkowski and he talks about the fact that this marionette voluntarily boarded the train to accompany the last Jew to Auschwitz. [SEP] I do not see any resemblance there with a marionette. Where I 'm concerned, he doesn 't explain why I was a marionette. He calls me a marionette and that 's that. [SEP] Everyone knows, he claims.
Dr. Murmelstein, when did you begin to work for the Jewish Community of Vienna? [SEP] I joined the administrative department of the Jewish Community in June 1938. [SEP] When it was reopened. [SEP] After the Anschluss?
Don 't forget, Madagascar is an island. [SEP] Yes, how could I forget that? [SEP] In short, a ghetto. Eichmann wrote, in a report, that to prevent other peoples from being contaminated, the ideal solution would be an island, overseas.
I have an indelible memory of our stop in Krakow. There were Jews working on the railroad. I looked out of the window and what I saw terrified me. I 'll never forget the look of those Jews. Their eyes could see, yet they were already dead. [SEP] Dead eyes! [SEP] Already in October? [SEP] In October, yes. They looked at us with dead eyes. Eyes that could see but that were dead. [SEP] There 's no other way to put it.
Religious Jews? Yes, with beards and Polish caftans. They were working on the railroad, on the tracks, adding ballast to them, etc. They saw right away that we were a train of Jews. They approached us but when I looked at them I felt scared. [SEP] Did you speak to them? [SEP] No, we couldn 't. We were with an SS escort. But we saw and looked at each other. Everything was said in those looks. The next day, we arrived in Nisko. [SEP] Then we walked for 12 kilometers. The bridge over the San had been bombed. From there, we were led to a hill overlooking the valley. We arrived at a place called Zarzecze.
It 's very hard to understand, I think. [SEP] Why did you take the decision to accept the responsibility of embellishing the town? [SEP] After all, it was a farce serving Nazi propaganda, wasn 't it? [SEP] You 're right. You 're playing the prosecutor.
But you had a taste for power, didn 't you? [SEP] It wasn 't a matter of power. [SEP] More a matter of the lack of power!
She 's so beautiful. It 's a Czech face. You have a young Czech girl there. [SEP] Yes, but a beauty.
She 's ready to leave on the convoy to Auschwitz. For the East. Yes, for the East. But today we know what Auschwitz was. [SEP] Yes, today we know. [SEP] Today we know. And you knew absolutely nothing about... Listen... Chelmno, Sobibor? [SEP] About Chelmno and Sobibor, nothing at all. [SEP] Auschwitz? We knew Birkenau. For us, Birkenau was a family ghetto, I already told you that.
Let 's leave it at that. Everything else you mention was thought out later. [SEP] Please, it 's true. When the Bialystok children... [SEP] What 's that story?
Edelstein was arrested and we know what happened. I needed to figure out why he had been arrested. He was arrested because he hadn 't dared to say no. We had to say no, that we wouldn 't pick anyone to make them leave. That had to be the Jews ' principle. [SEP] You want to deport the Jews? We can 't stop you. But choose them yourselves. The Nazis only cared about precise figures. Previously, the Jewish Elders drew up all the lists. Therefore, they eased their conscience. Of course, things degenerated and led to corruption. Dispensations were granted for friends, for family reasons, for money, for sexual needs, for every possible reason. All kinds of things. But... [SEP] For sexual reasons too? Yes. All kinds of things. There 's a book by Bashevis Singer, a novel, The Friends. In it, he writes, " When they say in a hundred years that the inhabitants of the ghettos were saints, there will be no greater lie. [SEP] I would add: they were martyrs, but not every martyr is a saint. They were martyrs but not saints. [SEP] So... Edelstein applied this system to excess. He thus made friends and supporters. He said yes to everyone. When a promise wasn 't kept, the person he made it to was simply deported and no one bothered. But there were transports to the East.
Yes. The people didn 't know at the time... People knew there was a ghetto for families in Birkenau. [SEP] That 's all they had been told. [SEP] Perhaps you know... [SEP] The " Czech families camp? [SEP] The ghetto for Czech families in Birkenau. You know that the people of the September convoy were held for six months just to write cards to their relatives and friends in Theresienstadt. Everything possible... With Freddy Hirsch, with Janowitz, with the goal of spreading the illusion in Theresienstadt that Birkenau was a subsidiary of Theresienstadt. So... It 's... But... I wanted to tell you... Yes, but...
Just a second, people didn 't know what Birkenau was?
Yes, but there are people... in Israel... like Gershom Scholem, for example, who thought and wrote that Murmelstein deserved to be hanged by the Jewish people. You see... You see, a long time ago... Mrs. Arendt 's reply to a letter that I wrote to her was published in the Neue Züricher Zeitung. And then I replied to it in the same paper. Do you want to know what I think of it? [SEP] Yes! You see, I could... Is it one of the reasons why you 've never been to Israel? [SEP] No, it 's not that but you see...
This were definitely the place. [SEP] Well, maybe they were having us on. They 'll be around here somewhere.
Georgiana. [SEP] Expecting someone? No. Excuse me, madam.
Shall I disappear from your sight? A few hours would be perfect. [SEP] Sister? [SEP] Mr Darcy?
No-one 's ever spoken to my brother as freely as you do. You 've brought such laughter to Pemberley, Elizabeth. I want that kind of ease for myself. [SEP] Do you have someone in mind? [SEP] Well, I 'd never marry without my brother 's approval, especially after... Darcy wants only for your happiness, Georgiana. We both do. [SEP] Even if my choice were a surprising one? [SEP] Ah, Colonel Fitzwilliam.
He 's early. [SEP] Were you expecting someone else? [SEP] No, no-one. I should go and greet my cousin. Mm.
I believe so... You must be looking forward to the ball. [SEP] Yes. Yes, we all are. I 'm not much of a man for dancing.
These are beautiful. Very beautiful this year. [SEP] And... the white bell, perhaps? [SEP] Two dozen of those.
Sorry - you scared me. [SEP] I 'm sorry. I wanted to catch you alone. [SEP] Could you spare me a moment? [SEP] Of course. You came through the woods, Colonel? [SEP] Er... no. I came the usual way. It 's about... Georgiana. With your keen powers of observation you will have noticed my... new-found appreciation of her. With the death of my older brother, and the duties and responsibilities that being the first son brings... And the freedom.
Of course... my mind has most naturally turned to marriage, and... as I am to return to the Army soon... [SEP] Well, has she... spoken to you about me? She always speaks of you in terms of affection. [SEP] Of course, but I... I imagine you to be her main confidante. Only when she has something to confide. I admit she has given me no specific grounds for hope, but I have known her since she was born, and... well, perhaps for a woman it is proper that love should come after marriage, rather than before it. I 'm not sure about that. I take it that George Wickham is... never received at Pemberley. [SEP] Of course not. Goodness, I 'm surprised you should even ask. [SEP] Well, so his attempted seduction of Georgiana has remained secret?
We can hardly bear to think of it, let alone mention his name. [SEP] Of course. Forgive me. I shouldn 't have mentioned it, Elizabeth. [SEP] Have you spoken of your feelings to Georgiana yet? No. I wanted to speak to you first, and ask Darcy 's permission, of course. Georgiana 's old enough to make her own decision, Colonel. If Georgiana were to agree to marry you, then... naturally, I would fully share my husband 's pleasure at the news. But perhaps it is best to wait until after the ball.
Good morning, Mrs Bidwell. Madam. [SEP] Louisa 's just back from helping my eldest in Birmingham, madam. [SEP] Madam. Sit down. She 's brought the new baby home with her for a while, to give Sarah some respite. [SEP] What 's his name? Georgie. I 'm sure she appreciates the help, but she must miss him terribly. [SEP] We can 't keep him much longer. Will frets ever so when he cries.
How is Will? He has good days and bad days. [SEP] Will? [SEP] Hello. Don 't get up. I just wanted to see how you 're getting along with those books. Ah. Robinson Crusoe was my favourite. Yes, I thought it might be. You shouldn 't have troubled yourself, ma 'am, not on the eve of the ball. [SEP] Oh, Mrs Reynolds has it all under control. [SEP] Well, tell her to not bring the ice in too early. She did that one year and there was water everywhere. You can tell her yourself next year. You don 't believe that, though.
You 're sure you 're all right? [SEP] I 'm fine. That madwoman could 've attacked you. [SEP] No, no. She was frightened, I 'm sure of it. I 'm fine.
Mr Alveston, such a pleasure to see you. [SEP] Well, thank you for the invitation.
